While some telecom networks have moved IT and other non-core operations to the public cloud, the move by the subsidiary of Spanish group Telefonica is a global first where an existing mobile operator is switching its core network to a public cloud.

Big cloud-computing services firms such as Amazon (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) have been trying to move more into the telecoms sector, lured by billions of dollars in potential revenue, but operators have been wary of the capability of public clouds in handling a mobile network.

2024-03-27,1711558495.0,"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment","Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race. 

The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup thats widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.

The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesdays news marks Amazons second tranche of that funding.

Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and wont have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startups last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. 

Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion  and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The companys product directly competes with OpenAIs ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.

News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAIs GPT-4 and Googles Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers experiences, and look forward to whats next, said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.

Amazons move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And its the second update in a week to Anthropics capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAIs ChatGPT first showcased the techs ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.

Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services dont want to be caught flat-footed.

Its a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. 

Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsofts OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startups valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsofts Azure is also OpenAIs exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startups success and new business flows back to Microsofts cloud servers.

Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.

Anthropics new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered multimodality, or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.

But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.

Anthropics Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.

Of course no model is perfect, and I think thats a very important thing to say upfront, Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. Weve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.

Amazons biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. 

These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven  Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla  has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.

AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook.

2024-08-26,1724688378.0,Amazon's Growth Challenges and Regulatory Pressures,"
Amazons stock has recently underperformed, sparking extensive discussions about its future. A major concern is the slowdown in e-commerce growth, especially after the explosive growth during the pandemic, which has dampened future market expectations. Additionally, regulatory pressures are mounting, with antitrust investigations from both US and European regulators closely scrutinizing Amazon's business model, potentially having a significant impact. Nevertheless, Amazons supporters believe the companys core strengths remain strong. AWS (Amazon Web Services) continues to be a major profit driver and maintains a dominant position globally. Moreover, Amazons expansion of its logistics network and increased ad revenue sources showcase its diversified business capabilities, keeping long-term investor optimism intact.

Data Analysis:
1.Stock Performance: Amazons stock has dropped about 15% in 2024, currently trading around $1200.
2.Financial Data: In Q2 2024 , e-commerce revenue growth slowed to 5%, while AWS revenue grew steadily at 25%.
3.Regulatory Issues: Increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly antitrust investigations in the US and Europe, could significantly impact the company.
Future Outlook:
1.Bearish Scenario: If e-commerce growth continues to slow and regulatory pressures increase, Amazon might face profitability challenges. The stock could decline further, especially if there are concerns about the companys future growth prospects.
2.Bullish Scenario: If Amazon can expand AWS business and increase ad revenue while managing regulatory challenges, the company may gradually recover its stock price.

2024-04-03,1712158783.0,Amazon cuts hundreds of jobs in cloud computing unit,"Amazons cloud computing division is laying off hundreds of employees in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

Weve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact, an AWS spokesperson said in a statement. We didnt make these decisions lightly, and were committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon.

The cuts were first reported by GeekWire.

Amazons lucrative AWS unit has seen its sales growth decelerate in recent quarters as companies trimmed their cloud spend amid rising interest rates. Amazon executives expressed some optimism in February when they said the market is starting to show signs of a reacceleration.

The cuts to AWS store technology team come after Amazon said it would remove cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The AWS unit includes teams overseeing the cashierless tech, called Just Walk Out, as well as its Dash smart carts and Amazon One palm-based payment technology. The store technology team was moved out of Amazons retail group and folded into its cloud computing division in 2022.

The AWS spokesperson said the company decided to make cuts to the store technology division as a result of a broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazons owned as well as in third-party stores.

Amazon continues to trim its headcount after more than a year of mass layoffs. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company. So far this year, Amazon has laid off employees in its Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, and Prime Video and MGM Studios units.

Employees in the U.S. will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.

2024-05-22,1716383717.0,Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul  and a monthly subscription price ,"Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazons plans. 

The Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazons subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. 

While Amazon wowed consumers with Alexas voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. 

Some interpreted last weeks announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apples voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the Alexa and Siri killers on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.

The development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources  but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. 

Three former employees pointed to Bezos early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founders passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.

That changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazons business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  

For instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didnt know an answer that was so easy to find online. 

When reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the companys annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business, adding that that included an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.

The team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.

As of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. 

Alexa, were you too early?

Apple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. 

Those who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that its going to be hard to turn the ship around. 

Theres also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAIs ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. 

Still, they point to Alexas installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that its already in peoples living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesnt understand a command or provides unreliable information. 

Amazon has been battling a perception that its behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the companys three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.

Amazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  

Bezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still very involved in Amazons AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS.

2024-08-01,1722535732.0,"Amazon's earnings are today, what are we doing?","Guys, yesterday I gave you [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) and anyone who followed got an easy 3-bagger. Last week, I predicted [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) and that got quite a few of you a lot of profits. Well today, we have AMZN's earnings. Is anyone reading these? I just wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think Amazon won't do well with their earnings.

As of right now, from what I've read, analysts expect Amazon to show revenue growth of 10.5% in its second-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday. They expect the following numbers:

* Earnings per share: $1.04 ($0.65 in Q2 2023)

* Revenue: $148.8 billion ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023)

* Amazon Web Services: $26 billion in revenue ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023)

* Advertising: $13 billion in revenue ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)

Honestly, it's been a mixed earnings season for a lot of big tech companies. Google parent Alphabet met analysts' expectations for the second quarter, but posted disappointing YouTube ad revenue and dropped like a rock. Microsoft's beat on the top and bottom lines but then they mentioned their lower-than-expected Azure cloud revenue. As I predicted, Meta's results topped analysts expectations, fueled by growth in its core digital ads business. And of course, Apple is also reporting today after the bell.

During the call, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on how Amazon Web Services fared during the quarter, as these guys are racing to provide more artificial intelligence offerings. Microsoft reported 29% growth in its rival Azure business, and Google Cloud grew at about the same rate. From what I see, Amazon (which leads the cloud infrastructure market) is expected to report growth of 17.6%.

Analysts at BofA Securities said they viewed Google's cloud results ""as a positive read-thru for AWS,"" adding that AWS should see tail winds from growth in its backlog revenue, and increasing demand from customers who need compute power to train their AI models.

Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWSs growth trajectory and the advertising segments contributions among Amazons strengths.

Amazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders. Honestly, I don't really have a very positive stance toward AI spending anymore. 

Meanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition (think Temu and Shein), companies that specialize in low-cost garbage that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It is possible Amazon will offer an update today on those efforts as it works to defend its first place on online shopping.

Let's take a look at Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. For the past two years, he's been more disciplined in the company's spending, and has looked for ways to slash costs. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts going into 2024.

Amazon's profit has rebounded sharply over the past year as a result of the cost cutting. Operating income soared 200% in the first quarter, and analysts expect further growth in the second quarter with year-over-year expansion of about 79%.

Amazon's advertising business has emerged as one of its biggest growth and profit engines. Revenue in the segment increased 24% year over year during the first quarter, and is expected to show 22% growth in the second.

Earlier this year, Amazon joined its streaming peers in including ads in Prime Video content. Prime Video users are now automatically shown ads, unless they pay an additional $2.99 a month to unlock the ad-free tier. What's funny is that in a note on July 21, Loop Capital analysts called this a ""gangster move"" that could help propel Amazon to become an ""advertising powerhouse.""

The ad business could haul in as much as $150 billion in sales before the end of the decade, up from $47 billion in annual sales last year, the Loop analysts wrote. They have a buy rating on Amazon's stock.

During the quarter, Amazon secured a highly sought after position as the third rights partner in the NBA's new 11-year TV deal. It's the latest example of Amazon's push into live sports and is likely to boost its advertising business and Prime Video platform, which Amazon uses to hook new Prime subscribers and drive purchases on its store.

And lastly, AMZN investors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet, and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs. So we'll have to see.

While all of this sounds great, I believe expecations have been set to high. And you know what that means? AMZN may drop quite a bit if they don't achieve and even surpass these expectations. So, I'll be grabbing a put spread. Unfortunately, due to today's price action, these puts are not exactly at a discount. I'll be buying the AMZN 8/2 180p @ 4.65 and selling the 175p @ 2.85. This means I can get the spread for only $180. If AMZN were to drop as much as I think it can, this spread can bag us 2.8x profits. Regardless of how well it does, next week we have PLTR, ABNB, and a few other key earnings. Lots of stuff to be excited for.

2024-03-21,1710991395.0,Amazon gets boost from 72% pop in AI company Astera Labs' IPO,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy loves to talk about how much his company is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. On Wednesday, Amazon got an AI boost in a different way.

Shares of Astera Labs, which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and AI infrastructure companies, soared 72% in their Nasdaq debut, closing at $62.03. That gives Astera a market cap of close to $9.5 billion.

Asteras IPO plays into Wall Streets thirst for all things AI. Founded in 2017 by former Texas Instruments executives, Astera counts Nvidia, AMD, and Intel among its customers. Its also selling heavily to Amazon.

The company got a major vote of confidence in 2022, when it struck a deal with Amazon that gave the tech giant warrants allowing it to buy up to 1.5 million shares of Asteras stock at $20.34 apiece. The following year, the agreement was amended, giving Amazon a warrant to buy more than 830,000 additional shares. As of the end of last year, Amazon controlled 232,608 shares, according to a securities filing.

Based on Wednesdays closing price, Amazons shares and warrants are worth a total of almost $144 million.

But in order for Amazon to vest the rest of its shares and fully benefit from the price pop, it must purchase up to $650 million worth of Asteras products in the coming years, according to the agreement. Thats a lot of money for Astera, which recorded total sales last year of $115.8 million, up from $79.9 million in 2022.

The three types of products Amazon has agreed to buy are are all designed to address critical bottlenecks in AI infrastructure, according to Asteras IPO prospectus.

Astera is joining the public markets as investors eagerly await social media company Reddits planned New York Stock Exchange debut Thursday. The tech IPO market has been largely dormant since late 2021, with Arm Holdings, Instacart and Klaviyo among the very few that have held offerings over that stretch.

2024-03-21,1711025569.0,Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

Before I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. 

# Introduction:

AMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.

# Investment Thesis:

***Established Logistics Network***  
AMZNs most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports.

2024-02-02,1706873146.0,Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.

Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.

Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.

Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.

In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.

We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.

AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.",stocks,227.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/,Amazon,POSITIVE,0.9565107822418213

2024-03-26,1711453795.0,Amazon launches same-day prescription delivery in New York and Los Angeles,"Amazons effort to get customers in the two largest U.S. markets whatever they want on the day of their order has expanded to include prescription drugs.

The e-commerce giant said on Tuesday that its rolling out same-day delivery of prescription medications in New York City and the greater Los Angeles area.

The prescriptions are offered via Amazons online pharmacy service, which launched in 2020. Amazon Pharmacy, born out of the companys 2018 acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack, allows customers to order prescription medications for home delivery, with free shipping for Prime members.

To speed up deliveries, Amazon said its using new, smaller facilities, stocked with the most common prescription medications for acute conditions. The locations are equipped to process a prescription within a matter of minutes rather than hours or days, the company said.

By bringing Amazon Pharmacys deliveries into our existing world-class logistics network, Amazon is building the fastest and most convenient service for the home delivery of prescription medications, Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in a statement. These faster delivery speeds will be a game changer when you or your family need your medications quickly.

San Bernardino, Riverside and Anaheim, which are all in the LA area, are eligible for same-day prescription deliveries starting Tuesday. The broader LA metro area will be up and running in April. The company plans to add more than a dozen other cities by the end of the year.

In October, Amazon began offering same-day prescription medication delivery in Seattle, Miami, Indianapolis, Phoenix and Austin, Texas. At the same time, the company said it would start sending prescription medications via drone in College Station, Texas, one of the two cities where Amazon is dispatching unmanned aircrafts to deliver items weighing five pounds or less.

The company said its dispatching e-bikes to handle some Amazon Pharmacy deliveries in New York. Amazon has been experimenting with e-cargo delivery bikes, which can speed up deliveries and cut down on emissions, in the city for the past several years.

2024-04-26,1714174416.0,Amazon Prime has framework deal for NBA broadcast rights,"In what will be a landmark move in sports media history, the NBA and Amazon Prime Video have the framework of a deal that will make the streaming service one of the main homes for the leagues games, executives with direct knowledge of the talks told The Athletic.

It is expected that Prime Videos package will include significant regular-season and postseason games, perhaps even some conference finals. The anticipation is that the final contract will be for at least a decade and begin the 2025-2026 season.

ESPN/ABC, as the website Puck reported Thursday, also has a framework of a deal with the expectations that an agreement will be completed. ESPN/ABC is expected to keep the NBA Finals on its networks for the duration of its deals. Like Amazon, ESPNs new contract also is expected to be at least a decade in length.

All of the details are not finalized yet, but all sides are under the expectations they will get done. The NBA, Amazon and ESPN all declined to comment.

The NBA prefers to have three companies involved in its new deals but has not ruled out adding a fourth.

The NBA is finishing nine-year deals that pay it $2.6 billion on average from ESPN and TNT Sports. Those contracts end after the 2024-2025 season.

The advancement in the Amazon and ESPN talks leaves incumbent Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns network TNT Sports, to face off with NBC, owned by Comcast, for the likely last package of games. Warner Bros. Discovery has the right to match deals, but NBC could structure an agreement in a way that makes it difficult.

While there is still work to be completed for the final arrangements, the current packages are going to be pruned slightly to create the third partner. In one arrangement, ESPN will cut down from around 100 games to around 80, according to executives briefed on the talks.

A natural landing spot for Amazons regular-season games could be Thursday night, where it already has the NFL from September to early January. In recent years, the NBA has moved its games off Thursday during that time to not go head-to-head with the NFL. It is expected to then have significant playoff inventory. Amazon has shown interest in global rights, which has been a key part of the NBAs negotiating strategy as it lined all of its domestic and international deals to end following the 2024-2025 season.

The NBA has made it clear that it wanted to define itself for the next frontier of viewing with streaming at the forefront.

With ESPN, Amazon and the NBA all under the impression that they will complete deals, this puts the onus on TNT Sports, which has had the NBA since 1984. It is in a fight with NBC, which was the lead partner of the NBA before losing its rights in 2002. NBC, with its streaming service Peacock, wants back in and is competing with Warner Bros. Discovery Sports for a deal.

2024-05-22,1716383717.0,Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul  and a monthly subscription price ,"Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazons plans. 

The Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazons subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. 

While Amazon wowed consumers with Alexas voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. 

Some interpreted last weeks announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apples voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the Alexa and Siri killers on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.

The development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources  but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. 

Three former employees pointed to Bezos early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founders passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.

That changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazons business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  

For instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didnt know an answer that was so easy to find online. 

When reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the companys annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business, adding that that included an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.

The team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.

As of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. 

Alexa, were you too early?

Apple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. 

Those who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that its going to be hard to turn the ship around. 

Theres also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAIs ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. 

Still, they point to Alexas installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that its already in peoples living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesnt understand a command or provides unreliable information. 

Amazon has been battling a perception that its behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the companys three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.

Amazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  

Bezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still very involved in Amazons AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS.

2024-07-22,1721680708.0,Warner Bros. Discovery tells NBA it intends to match Amazon media rights package ,"Warner Bros. Discovery said Monday it has informed the National Basketball Association that it intends to use its matching rights for a package of games earmarked for another company. Warner Bros. Discovery is targeting the deal between the NBC and Amazon Prime Video, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In an effort to continue our long-standing partnership, during both exclusive and non-exclusive negotiation periods, we acted in/good faith to/present/strong bids that were fair to both parties. Regrettably,/the league notified us of its intention to accept other offers for the games in our current rights package, leaving us to proceed under the/matching rights provision, which is an integral part of our current agreement and the rights we have paid for under it, Warner Bros Discovery said in a statement. /

We have reviewed the offers and matched one of them. This will allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years, the company said. Our matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.

Warner Bros. Discovery acquired matching rights as part of its previous deal with the league, which expires at the end of next season. Those rights allow the company to match payment for any of the games that aired on TNT in the current deal.

The question for both the NBA and Warner Bros. Discovery is if the rights extend to an all-streaming package, as has been carved out for Amazon. Warner Bros. Discovery also owns a streaming service, Max, which it could use to air games.

Still, Amazon Prime Video has more than twice as many global customers  more than 200 million to Maxs roughly 100 million  which may make the service a more appealing platform for the league. The streaming rights are global, even though Warner Bros. Discovery is only bidding on U.S. rights, according to people familiar with the language in the contract.

Amazon is also on firmer footing as a standalone company, with a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion. Warner Bros. Discoverys market valuation has fallen to about $20 billion, and CEO David Zaslav has repeatedly discussed his interest in more mergers or partnerships, putting the future of the company into question. Thats an added potential headache for the league, which wants stability in its broadcast partners. The league has also inked deals with Disney and Comcasts NBCUniversal for two other packages of games. Both Disney and Comcast have market valuations of more than $150 billion.

If the NBA rejects Warner Bros. Discoverys right to match the Amazon package, what happens next remains unclear. Its possible Warner Bros. Discovery could sue the NBA. Its also possible the league could work out a settlement with the company. Its unclear if the NBA would ask Amazon to pay more money for its package.

One possibility that isnt likely is crafting a fourth package of games, according to people familiar with the matter. In the past two months, the NBA has entertained putting together a fourth package, but those talks fizzled because deals were already in place with Disney, Comcast and Amazon, and those partners didnt want to give away inventory, said the people. All three partners plan to pay more money for fewer games than the league is currently getting from either Disney or Warner Bros. Discovery in its current deal.

Disney will pay about $2.6 billion per year for its package, and NBCUniversal around $2.5 billion per year, CNBC has previously reported. Amazons deal is worth $1.8 billion per year. The less expensive price tag is why Warner Bros. Discovery has targeted that package of games for its matching rights, according to people familiar with the matter.

The NBA also hasnt wanted to carve out too many packages because its sensitive to consumer confusion and limiting the number of services for which fans need to subscribe, the people said. While Amazon plans to include NBA games with its Prime subscribers at no extra charge, Maxs sports strategy includes an additional $9.99-per-month fee for access to live games on top of a basic Max membership. Warner Bros. Discovery hasnt decided if it will include the NBA games on its basic tier or sports tier, according to people familiar with the matter.

The first ceiling created 3 years ago was mostly because Bezos stepped down as CEO, appointing Andy as his replacement. This caused a lot of confusion for investors about the sudden change and new management.

Moving on to this year with the stock trying to break that ceiling. First attempt around February, again partly or fully blocked by Bezos selling shares and somehow leaking an email that involved him addressing his worries about Amazons position in the AI race. Second attempt of a breakout in past two months again blocked by him as he announces his plan to sell 25 million shares, all apparently with a limit order of $200. Completing refusing to sell below that price, therefore creating an artificial wall.

 Warner Bros. Discoverys most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Videos offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon, the NBA said in a statement Wednesday.

 Throughout these negotiations, our primary objective has been to maximize the reach and accessibility of our games for our fans. Our new arrangement with Amazon supports this goal by complementing the broadcast, cable and streaming packages that are already part of our new Disney and NBCUniversal arrangements, the league added. All three partners have also committed substantial resources to promote the league and enhance the fan experience. We are grateful to Turner Sports for its award-winning coverage of the NBA and look forward to another season of the NBA on TNT.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Monday it matched one of the NBAs three media rights packages, which people familiar with the matter identified as the $1.93 billion per-year deal earmarked for Amazon Prime Video. Disney and Comcasts NBCUniversal signed deals for the other two packages, part of the leagues $77 billion media rights renewal over 11 years.

Jassy told CNBC in April 2022 that if employees were to vote in a union, they may be less empowered in the workplace and things would become much slower and more bureaucratic. Similarly, in the Bloomberg interview, Jassy remarked, if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you cant just go to your manager and say, Lets change it.

At the DealBook conference, Jassy said that without a union the workplace isnt bureaucratic, its not slow.

Gee said the comments threatened employees that, if they selected a union, they would become less empowered and would find it harder to get things done quickly.

The NLRB filed the complaint against Amazon and Jassy in October 2022. In his ruling Wednesday, Gee said Jassys other comments that unionization would change workers relationship with their employer were lawful. But the Amazon chiefs other remarks that employees would be less empowered and better off without a union violated labor law, because they went beyond merely commenting on the employee-employer relationship.

Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in a statement that the company disagrees with the NLRBs ruling and that it intends to appeal.

The decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard, Paradis said.

The judge recommends Amazon be ordered to cease and desist from making such comments in the future, and that the company be required to post and distribute a notice about the order to employees nationwide.

2024-05-22,1716383717.0,Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul  and a monthly subscription price ,"Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazons plans. 

The Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazons subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. 

While Amazon wowed consumers with Alexas voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. 

Some interpreted last weeks announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apples voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the Alexa and Siri killers on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.

The development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources  but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. 

Three former employees pointed to Bezos early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founders passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.

That changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazons business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  

For instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didnt know an answer that was so easy to find online. 

When reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the companys annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business, adding that that included an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.

The team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.

As of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. 

Alexa, were you too early?

Apple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. 

Those who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that its going to be hard to turn the ship around. 

Theres also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAIs ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. 

Still, they point to Alexas installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that its already in peoples living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesnt understand a command or provides unreliable information. 

Amazon has been battling a perception that its behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the companys three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.

Amazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  

Bezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still very involved in Amazons AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS.

2024-04-11,1712834538.0,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.

I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which were investing, Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.

Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.

Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said hes focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains resilient. He stressed the importance of building primitive services, which he described as discrete, foundational building blocks that can spur new projects and businesses.

Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazons CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazons most profitable businesses.

He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazons next primitive service that could transform the company. Were optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS, Jassy wrote.

Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.

In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazons businesses.

2024-08-01,1722535732.0,"Amazon's earnings are today, what are we doing?","Guys, yesterday I gave you [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) and anyone who followed got an easy 3-bagger. Last week, I predicted [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) and that got quite a few of you a lot of profits. Well today, we have AMZN's earnings. Is anyone reading these? I just wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think Amazon won't do well with their earnings.

As of right now, from what I've read, analysts expect Amazon to show revenue growth of 10.5% in its second-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday. They expect the following numbers:

* Earnings per share: $1.04 ($0.65 in Q2 2023)

* Revenue: $148.8 billion ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023)

* Amazon Web Services: $26 billion in revenue ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023)

* Advertising: $13 billion in revenue ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)

Honestly, it's been a mixed earnings season for a lot of big tech companies. Google parent Alphabet met analysts' expectations for the second quarter, but posted disappointing YouTube ad revenue and dropped like a rock. Microsoft's beat on the top and bottom lines but then they mentioned their lower-than-expected Azure cloud revenue. As I predicted, Meta's results topped analysts expectations, fueled by growth in its core digital ads business. And of course, Apple is also reporting today after the bell.

During the call, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on how Amazon Web Services fared during the quarter, as these guys are racing to provide more artificial intelligence offerings. Microsoft reported 29% growth in its rival Azure business, and Google Cloud grew at about the same rate. From what I see, Amazon (which leads the cloud infrastructure market) is expected to report growth of 17.6%.

Analysts at BofA Securities said they viewed Google's cloud results ""as a positive read-thru for AWS,"" adding that AWS should see tail winds from growth in its backlog revenue, and increasing demand from customers who need compute power to train their AI models.

Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWSs growth trajectory and the advertising segments contributions among Amazons strengths.

Amazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders. Honestly, I don't really have a very positive stance toward AI spending anymore. 

Meanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition (think Temu and Shein), companies that specialize in low-cost garbage that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It is possible Amazon will offer an update today on those efforts as it works to defend its first place on online shopping.

Let's take a look at Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. For the past two years, he's been more disciplined in the company's spending, and has looked for ways to slash costs. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts going into 2024.

Amazon's profit has rebounded sharply over the past year as a result of the cost cutting. Operating income soared 200% in the first quarter, and analysts expect further growth in the second quarter with year-over-year expansion of about 79%.

Amazon's advertising business has emerged as one of its biggest growth and profit engines. Revenue in the segment increased 24% year over year during the first quarter, and is expected to show 22% growth in the second.

Earlier this year, Amazon joined its streaming peers in including ads in Prime Video content. Prime Video users are now automatically shown ads, unless they pay an additional $2.99 a month to unlock the ad-free tier. What's funny is that in a note on July 21, Loop Capital analysts called this a ""gangster move"" that could help propel Amazon to become an ""advertising powerhouse.""

The ad business could haul in as much as $150 billion in sales before the end of the decade, up from $47 billion in annual sales last year, the Loop analysts wrote. They have a buy rating on Amazon's stock.

During the quarter, Amazon secured a highly sought after position as the third rights partner in the NBA's new 11-year TV deal. It's the latest example of Amazon's push into live sports and is likely to boost its advertising business and Prime Video platform, which Amazon uses to hook new Prime subscribers and drive purchases on its store.

And lastly, AMZN investors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet, and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs. So we'll have to see.

While all of this sounds great, I believe expecations have been set to high. And you know what that means? AMZN may drop quite a bit if they don't achieve and even surpass these expectations. So, I'll be grabbing a put spread. Unfortunately, due to today's price action, these puts are not exactly at a discount. I'll be buying the AMZN 8/2 180p @ 4.65 and selling the 175p @ 2.85. This means I can get the spread for only $180. If AMZN were to drop as much as I think it can, this spread can bag us 2.8x profits. Regardless of how well it does, next week we have PLTR, ABNB, and a few other key earnings. Lots of stuff to be excited for. I'm going to definitely be checking out a few of those.",wallstreetbets,225.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehnhtp/amazons_earnings_are_today_what_are_we_doing/,Amazon,NEGATIVE,0.9916123151779175
2024-06-27,1719450964.0,Amazon plans to launch discount store in bid to fend off Temu and Shein ,"Amazon plans to launch a new section on its site dedicated to low-priced fashion and lifestyle items that will allow Chinese sellers to ship directly to U.S. consumers, CNBC has learned.

The storefront, announced at an invite-only conference for Chinese sellers on Wednesday, would mark Amazons most aggressive attempt yet to fend off growing competition from e-commerce upstarts Temu and Shein, which both have ties to China, the worlds second-largest economy.

Temu and Shein have expanded their presence in the U.S. in recent years, luring an increasing share of American shoppers with their rock-bottom prices on clothing, electronics, home goods and other products.

Amazons storefront will feature a range of unbranded items, many priced under $20, according to a presentation to Amazon sellers viewed by CNBC. A mock-up of the storefront showed a gua sha facial massaging tool, arm weights and phone cases, among other items for sale.

Amazon will ship the products directly from China to the U.S., with the goal of delivering them to shoppers within nine to 11 days, the presentation shows. In the past, Amazon sellers in China have relied on the companys fulfillment services, called Fulfillment by Amazon, to send goods to warehouses in the U.S. before they are dispatched to customers.

The company pitched the arrangement as cost savings for Amazon sellers in China, and said merchants would be able to test new items through small-batch production. Shein uses a similar model, referred to as on-demand manufacturing, producing a limited quantity of goods and manufacturing more as demand increases.

In a statement to CNBC, Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said, We are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.

Boschetti declined to comment further on the companys plans, which were first reported by The Information. It is unclear when Amazon intends to debut the storefront, but the presentation notes it will start accepting products this fall.

China-based merchants have made up a sizable contingent of Amazons marketplace for many years, but the company is making a renewed push to court sellers there as it faces growing competition. In December, Amazon announced a new innovation center in Shenzhen, a popular technology and manufacturing hub, and it also slashed the fees it charges merchants selling clothing priced below $20.

Amazon said in 2023 the number of items sold by Chinese sellers on its site grew more than 20% year over year, while the number of Chinese merchants with sales upward of $10 million increased 30%.

2024-03-06,1709756460.0,The downfall of Amazon $AMZN has started.,"Investors and consumers need to know this very important fact about Amazon (Marketplace). They just dug their own grave. Third party sellers make up about 65% of the sales generated on Amazon and recently they did a dirty move to third sellers that will have many leaving the platform or raising prices so high that Amazon becomes uncompetitive to consumers. Amazon just announced/implemented two new double-dip fees that will crush third party sellers and that's not even an exaggeration.

The first fee which has been implemented already is an ""inbound placement fee"" which is a shipping fee Amazon tacks on to send inventory to Amazon ""Prime"" for Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This fee has increased the shipping cost for third party sellers by 6-10x. For example, a seller sending a truckload of inventory (prior to this inbound placement fee) to Amazon traditionally spent about $600-$800, sometimes way more. Now on top of this they are charged with the inbound placement fee of about $3,000-$5,000. This essentially wipes out a huge chunk, if not most, of the profit margin for a seller on Amazon. Add in the additional fees Amazon charges: 15% referral fee (just to list on their site), 8-15% fulfillment fee (FBA; picking, packing and delivery), storage fees (around $0.78 per cubic foot) and advertising costs (about 2-15% of the price of each good depending on the market).

The second fee which will take place in about a month is a ""low inventory fee"" which is a fee imposed by the Amazon algorithm when inventory is starting to run low at Amazon fulfillment centers. This fee can be anywhere from $0.32-$1.11 PER ITEM. The kicker is that the Amazon fulfillment center receiving process is a huge cluster fuck that can take 30+ days to inbound and check-in from when the Seller ships it. That is, if Amazon doesn't lose or damage the goods at the warehouse OR during delivery.

So by the time Amazon ships a product out to a customer, they have essentially pocketed about 60% of the sale. When you take out the cost of the good for the seller, that leaves them with very little profit margin, if any. The margins were already razor thin before these rate hikes and now they are all but gone.

Why is this important to investors and customers? The only solution for third party sellers to barely keep their head above the water and maintain a remote semblance of their razor thin margins prior to the new fees is to raise prices. I'm talking 20-30% price increases are required at a minimum just to get back to par. You want to talk about all the issues with inflation well, now you know, corporate greed is being shown at its finest. Amazon reported a $30.4 billion net income for 2023 but will penny pinch third party sellers even more at the expense of driving prices up for consumers like never before seen on the platform. This will cause consumers to look elsewhere to shop other than Amazon because Amazon will now be highly uncompetitive. It's just a matter of time. Amazon shot themselves in the foot and needs to reverse course on these absurd fees.

The stock rallied in June, recovering losses from the end of May to gain about 27% so far this year.

Shares of the megacap technology company have gotten a lift over the past year as the company cut costs and restructured its business to better take advantage of the AI frenzy.

2024-03-27,1711558495.0,"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment","Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race. 

The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup thats widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.

The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesdays news marks Amazons second tranche of that funding.

Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and wont have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startups last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. 

Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion  and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The companys product directly competes with OpenAIs ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.

News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAIs GPT-4 and Googles Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers experiences, and look forward to whats next, said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.

Amazons move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And its the second update in a week to Anthropics capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAIs ChatGPT first showcased the techs ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.

Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services dont want to be caught flat-footed.

Its a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. 

Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsofts OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startups valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsofts Azure is also OpenAIs exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startups success and new business flows back to Microsofts cloud servers.

Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.

Anthropics new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered multimodality, or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.

But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.

Anthropics Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.

Of course no model is perfect, and I think thats a very important thing to say upfront, Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. Weve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.

Amazons biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. 

These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven  Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla  has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.

2024-05-22,1716383717.0,Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul  and a monthly subscription price ,"Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazons plans. 

The Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazons subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. 

While Amazon wowed consumers with Alexas voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. 

Some interpreted last weeks announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apples voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the Alexa and Siri killers on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.

The development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources  but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. 

Three former employees pointed to Bezos early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founders passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.

That changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazons business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  

For instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didnt know an answer that was so easy to find online. 

When reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the companys annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business, adding that that included an even more intelligent and capable Alexa.

The team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.

As of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. 

Alexa, were you too early?

Apple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. 

Those who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that its going to be hard to turn the ship around. 

Theres also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAIs ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. 

Still, they point to Alexas installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that its already in peoples living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesnt understand a command or provides unreliable information. 

Amazon has been battling a perception that its behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the companys three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.

Amazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  

Bezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still very involved in Amazons AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS.

2024-08-01,1722535732.0,"Amazon's earnings are today, what are we doing?","Guys, yesterday I gave you [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) and anyone who followed got an easy 3-bagger. Last week, I predicted [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) and that got quite a few of you a lot of profits. Well today, we have AMZN's earnings. Is anyone reading these? I just wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think Amazon won't do well with their earnings.

As of right now, from what I've read, analysts expect Amazon to show revenue growth of 10.5% in its second-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday. They expect the following numbers:

* Earnings per share: $1.04 ($0.65 in Q2 2023)

* Revenue: $148.8 billion ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023)

* Amazon Web Services: $26 billion in revenue ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023)

* Advertising: $13 billion in revenue ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)

Honestly, it's been a mixed earnings season for a lot of big tech companies. Google parent Alphabet met analysts' expectations for the second quarter, but posted disappointing YouTube ad revenue and dropped like a rock. Microsoft's beat on the top and bottom lines but then they mentioned their lower-than-expected Azure cloud revenue. As I predicted, Meta's results topped analysts expectations, fueled by growth in its core digital ads business. And of course, Apple is also reporting today after the bell.

During the call, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on how Amazon Web Services fared during the quarter, as these guys are racing to provide more artificial intelligence offerings. Microsoft reported 29% growth in its rival Azure business, and Google Cloud grew at about the same rate. From what I see, Amazon (which leads the cloud infrastructure market) is expected to report growth of 17.6%.

Analysts at BofA Securities said they viewed Google's cloud results ""as a positive read-thru for AWS,"" adding that AWS should see tail winds from growth in its backlog revenue, and increasing demand from customers who need compute power to train their AI models.

Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWSs growth trajectory and the advertising segments contributions among Amazons strengths.

Amazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders. Honestly, I don't really have a very positive stance toward AI spending anymore. 

Meanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition (think Temu and Shein), companies that specialize in low-cost garbage that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It is possible Amazon will offer an update today on those efforts as it works to defend its first place on online shopping.

Let's take a look at Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. For the past two years, he's been more disciplined in the company's spending, and has looked for ways to slash costs. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts going into 2024.

Amazon's profit has rebounded sharply over the past year as a result of the cost cutting. Operating income soared 200% in the first quarter, and analysts expect further growth in the second quarter with year-over-year expansion of about 79%.

Amazon's advertising business has emerged as one of its biggest growth and profit engines. Revenue in the segment increased 24% year over year during the first quarter, and is expected to show 22% growth in the second.

Earlier this year, Amazon joined its streaming peers in including ads in Prime Video content. Prime Video users are now automatically shown ads, unless they pay an additional $2.99 a month to unlock the ad-free tier. What's funny is that in a note on July 21, Loop Capital analysts called this a ""gangster move"" that could help propel Amazon to become an ""advertising powerhouse.""

The ad business could haul in as much as $150 billion in sales before the end of the decade, up from $47 billion in annual sales last year, the Loop analysts wrote. They have a buy rating on Amazon's stock.

During the quarter, Amazon secured a highly sought after position as the third rights partner in the NBA's new 11-year TV deal. It's the latest example of Amazon's push into live sports and is likely to boost its advertising business and Prime Video platform, which Amazon uses to hook new Prime subscribers and drive purchases on its store.

And lastly, AMZN investors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet, and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs. So we'll have to see.

While all of this sounds great, I believe expecations have been set to high. And you know what that means? AMZN may drop quite a bit if they don't achieve and even surpass these expectations. So, I'll be grabbing a put spread. Unfortunately, due to today's price action, these puts are not exactly at a discount. I'll be buying the AMZN 8/2 180p @ 4.65 and selling the 175p @ 2.85. This means I can get the spread for only $180. If AMZN were to drop as much as I think it can, this spread can bag us 2.8x profits.

Including the new Alexa subscription, with Amazon moving in the direction of AI, they have an opportunity to make something comparable to the IPhone, THE Home AI. Something that everyone will have. They could also open the idea of rolling out yearly updated models.

Last week, I predicted [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) and that got quite a few of you a lot of profits. Well today, we have AMZN's earnings. Is anyone reading these? I just wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think Amazon won't do well with their earnings.

As of right now, from what I've read, analysts expect Amazon to show revenue growth of 10.5% in its second-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday. They expect the following numbers:

* Earnings per share: $1.04 ($0.65 in Q2 2023)

* Revenue: $148.8 billion ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023)

* Amazon Web Services: $26 billion in revenue ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023)

* Advertising: $13 billion in revenue ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)

Honestly, it's been a mixed earnings season for a lot of big tech companies. Google parent Alphabet met analysts' expectations for the second quarter, but posted disappointing YouTube ad revenue and dropped like a rock. Microsoft's beat on the top and bottom lines but then they mentioned their lower-than-expected Azure cloud revenue. As I predicted, Meta's results topped analysts expectations, fueled by growth in its core digital ads business. And of course, Apple is also reporting today after the bell.

During the call, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on how Amazon Web Services fared during the quarter, as these guys are racing to provide more artificial intelligence offerings. Microsoft reported 29% growth in its rival Azure business, and Google Cloud grew at about the same rate. From what I see, Amazon (which leads the cloud infrastructure market) is expected to report growth of 17.6%.

Analysts at BofA Securities said they viewed Google's cloud results ""as a positive read-thru for AWS,"" adding that AWS should see tail winds from growth in its backlog revenue, and increasing demand from customers who need compute power to train their AI models.

Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWSs growth trajectory and the advertising segments contributions among Amazons strengths.

Amazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders. Honestly, I don't really have a very positive stance toward AI spending anymore. 

Meanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition (think Temu and Shein), companies that specialize in low-cost garbage that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It is possible Amazon will offer an update today on those efforts as it works to defend its first place on online shopping.

2024-03-21,1711025569.0,Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

Before I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. 

# Introduction:

AMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.

# Investment Thesis:

***Established Logistics Network***  
AMZNs most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports.

2024-02-02,1706873146.0,Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.

Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.

Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.

Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.

In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.

We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.

AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.",stocks,227.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ah1ift/amazon_stock_analysis_why_its_my_only_holding_in/,Amazon,POSITIVE,0.9565107822418213

2023-09-25,1695632486.0,"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI","E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazons aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and AlphabetsGoogle.

Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAIs ChatGPT, as well as Anthropics Claude chatbots.

The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. 

This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidias key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidias stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.

To an extent, Amazons deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropics AI models via Amazon Bedrock  a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.

Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.

Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsofts multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apples most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the companys total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so thats sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBCs Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesnt know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

What weve done is weve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things, Cook said. From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners financials, and we would be paying expense. 

Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount were spending for AI and Apple intelligence, Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers havent owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apples Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under Wearables, Home, and Accessories. Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, were still growing that base significantly, Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the companys content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apples forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apples active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apples App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base, Cook said. Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year. 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

2024-05-13,1715633331.0,Why Apple will integrate OpenAI's GPT-4o with Siri,"OpenAI just [announced GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), their new and improved flagship model for ChatGPT, and I'm betting that this is the model that Apple will integrate with Siri soon.

**Here's why:**

* It's VERY fast and now multimodal. It can ""see"" the world around you. Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) says it is the best interface he's ever used. He said, ""It feels like AI from the movies,"" and he's not wrong. It's magic. You can ask it to look around you and solve math equations, offer outfit suggestions, help you figure out who and what you're looking at, and more. The demos that they [showcased today during their livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?si=WR9xjFTpltNX1Ptc) were magical.
* It can help you navigate the world and physical spaces. This is something that Meta, Humane, and Rabbit have been trying to do with their multi-modal devices ([Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses), [Humane AI Pin](https://humane.com/), [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/)).
* It has improved memory and remembers context and details about you, what you do, and what you ask it to do. It's like having a deeply personalized personal assistant. Think Jarvis in Iron Man.
* It sounds NATURAL and, more importantly, reacts naturally. You can interrupt it mid-sentence, and it'll stop to listen to you, just like a real human. It's akin to the movie ""Her"". There's a reason they made the default voice sound like Scarlett Johansson.
* They've announced an exclusive MacOS app that integrates seamlessly into your workflow and allows you to upload screenshots to offer feedback on coding or your writing; you can voice chat with it and also have it summarize notes/ meetings. Nothing for windows yet.
* Siri is terrible as it currently stands. We have a ton of anecdotal evidence. Just look at r/iphone or any discussion around why [Siri has gotten worse over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/169l5o6/siri_is_more_than_useless_at_this_point/). It's no secret that Amazon and Google have proven that their assistants are better in many ways, but they don't have the Apple ecosystem. This is the only reason Siri is remotely tolerable.
* The [2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/) is happening in a little under a month, from June 10th - June 14th. They will be announcing the new features and direction for iOS18. Tim Cook stated on their recent earnings call, ""We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apples unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration.
* Apple scrapped its semi-autonomous electric vehicle project and re-focused on AI [about two months ago](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-scraps-ev-plans-highlighting-shifting-focus-on-ai-8601590).
* Bloomberg released this article on Friday. [Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone?embedded-checkout=true). In it, they state that ""The two sides have been finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apples iOS 18, the next iPhone operating system"".
* Forbes posted this earlier today: [Apples New ChatGPT DealHeres What It Means For iPhone Security. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/05/13/apples-new-chatgpt-deal-heres-what-it-means-for-your-iphone/?sh=68e0793e583e)

I think we're at a pivotal time in tech with AI large language models, which are finally getting to the point where they are refined and fast enough to be harnessed for general-use cases. With its seamless tech, Apple will ride this wave and finally make Siri the magical assistant that it was always supposed to be.

\*\*My position is 600 shares bought at an average cost of $186.10, bought right at market close today. I'm planning on holding them long-term. Tomorrow, I'll purchase some long-dated calls. Roast me all you want. I wanted to make sure I had all of my analysis squared away before I bought in.

2024-06-17,1718644573.0,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Fridays close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidias weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

Understanding how they might be weighted, where theyre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make whats beneath the label seem different from fund to fund, Bartolini said.

2024-05-11,1715393866.0,"Apple nears deal with OpenAI to power upcoming iPhone features with ChatGPT, says Bloomberg","After talking with both OpenAI and Google about their AI models, Apple is nearing a deal to partner with OpenAI and leverage ChatGPT for upcoming iPhone features, reports Bloomberg. We can expect to see the workings of both companies as soon as next month, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

According to Mark Gurman, who spoke with ""people familiar with the matter,"" Apple first renewed talks with OpenAI to use the startup's tech to power new AI features coming to future iPhones, and is now nearing a formal partnership. 

This comes shortly after Apple was reportedly in talks with Google to license Gemini for various iPhone services. ""Those discussions haven't led to an agreement, but are ongoing,"" says Gurman.

The news comes shortly after OpenAI announced it would be unveiling new ChatGPT features this upcoming Monday, a day before Google I/O. Talks between the Microsoft-backed AI company and Apple were apparently pretty far along, Bloomberg previously reported, as discussions of an agreement had occurred for some time.

While Apple has plenty of researchers working on the company's own AI models, those don't seem quite ready to be the star of the show, so the company has been looking for outside help.

The next big iPhone update, iOS 18, will most likely be announced during WWDC on June 10. With Apple nearing a deal with OpenAI, we may see some familiar ChatGPT capabilities integrated across popular iOS features like iMessage, FaceTime, and, of course, Siri.

It's worth pointing out that OpenAI's ChatGPT app came to the iPhone about two months before landing on Android. Apple hasn't officially announced any AI features for the iPhone, but if you look at the Pixel 8 Pro or the Galaxy S24, you can get an idea of what the new features might be: generative AI photo editing, transcription of voice memos, webpage summarization, text generation, custom wallpapers, and so on.

There aren't any details about what iPhone models the new AI might be available on, but if Apple follows its competitors, the features will likely debut on the newest flagship and slowly trickle down to other models.

Apple has been investing a lot in artificial intelligence recently, and soon the company will introduce its own generative AI to the world. In fact, it looks like the company is taking AI seriously, as a new report claims that Apple is developing a new chip specifically to power AI processing data centers.

A report by the Wall Street Journal says that the company is building AI chips for data centers, potentially to run some of its new AI-based features to be announced at WWDC 2024 next month.

Apple has been working on its own chip designed to run artificial intelligence software in data center servers, a move that has the potential to provide the company with a key advantage in the AI arms race, Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie told the WSJ, citing sources familiar with the matter. The project is known as ACDC  for Apple Chips in Data Center.
The report comes after analyst Jeff Pu of Haitong International Securities said this week that Apple is using both M2 Ultra and M4 chips to power servers dedicated to iOS 18s new AI-based features.

The company is expected to introduce many features based on generative AI with iOS 18 and other software updates to be announced in June at WWDC 2024. Apple has also been developing its own language models that can run offline. However, these models are more limited, so having online alternatives would be ideal for providing more accurate results.

Apple said in a statement that the features  Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product  wont be available to EU customers due to Apples belief that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as gatekeepers in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the companys AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also wont be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.

2024-06-17,1718644552.0,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Fridays close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidias weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

Understanding how they might be weighted, where theyre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make whats beneath the label seem different from fund to fund, Bartolini said.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

2024-05-11,1715393866.0,"Apple nears deal with OpenAI to power upcoming iPhone features with ChatGPT, says Bloomberg","After talking with both OpenAI and Google about their AI models, Apple is nearing a deal to partner with OpenAI and leverage ChatGPT for upcoming iPhone features, reports Bloomberg. We can expect to see the workings of both companies as soon as next month, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

According to Mark Gurman, who spoke with ""people familiar with the matter,"" Apple first renewed talks with OpenAI to use the startup's tech to power new AI features coming to future iPhones, and is now nearing a formal partnership. 

This comes shortly after Apple was reportedly in talks with Google to license Gemini for various iPhone services. ""Those discussions haven't led to an agreement, but are ongoing,"" says Gurman.

The news comes shortly after OpenAI announced it would be unveiling new ChatGPT features this upcoming Monday, a day before Google I/O. Talks between the Microsoft-backed AI company and Apple were apparently pretty far along, Bloomberg previously reported, as discussions of an agreement had occurred for some time.

While Apple has plenty of researchers working on the company's own AI models, those don't seem quite ready to be the star of the show, so the company has been looking for outside help.

The next big iPhone update, iOS 18, will most likely be announced during WWDC on June 10. With Apple nearing a deal with OpenAI, we may see some familiar ChatGPT capabilities integrated across popular iOS features like iMessage, FaceTime, and, of course, Siri.

It's worth pointing out that OpenAI's ChatGPT app came to the iPhone about two months before landing on Android. Apple hasn't officially announced any AI features for the iPhone, but if you look at the Pixel 8 Pro or the Galaxy S24, you can get an idea of what the new features might be: generative AI photo editing, transcription of voice memos, webpage summarization, text generation, custom wallpapers, and so on.

There aren't any details about what iPhone models the new AI might be available on, but if Apple follows its competitors, the features will likely debut on the newest flagship and slowly trickle down to other models.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apples, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidias huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the companys overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apples sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidias stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

2024-06-24,1719226990.0,European Union regulators accuse Apple of breaching the bloc's tech rules ,"European Union regulators on Monday said that Apple is in breach of sweeping new tech rules because it does not allow customers of its App Store to be steered to alternatives.

The European Commission, the EUs executive arm, also said it had opened a new probe into Apple into new contractual terms with developers.

The EU opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to reel in the power of Big Tech firms. So-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

On Monday, regulators said in their preliminary findings that Apple was in breach of the DMA because its App Store rules prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

Apple only allows steering through a system where app developers can provide a link that sends users to a webpage where they can then purchase content, such as a subscription, according to the Commission. However, this process is subject to several restrictions imposed by Apple that prevent app developers from communicating, promoting offers and concluding contracts through the distribution channel of their choice, the Commission noted.

The regulators also said that the fees Apple charges developers for the initial acquisition of new customers via the App Store go beyond what is strictly necessary. The Commission did not disclose what represents a strictly necessary fee.

Apple could face fines of up to 10% of the companys total worldwide annual turnover, if it is found in breach of the DMA.

The U.S. tech giant has been in EUs crosshairs this year. Regulators hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.93 billion) antitrust fine in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. The steering rules were also a focus in that investigation.

EU opens another DMA probe

Apple made some big changes to its App Store in the EU this year in anticipation of the DMA. The Cupertino giant now allows apps to be downloaded from websites, as well as third-party app stores on its devices.

But the Commission also raised concerns about some of Apples new practices.

Apple still charges a core technology fee of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per app installed for downloads outside its own App Store. The Commission said it is looking into whether this complies with the DMA.

Regulators are also looking at whether the steps Apple makes users take to download alternative app stores or apps comply with the blocs rules.

The Commission will also look at whether eligibility requirements related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones is also in compliance with the tech law.

2024-06-28,1719606544.0,Apples First Investor Story - Power of Long Term Investing,"A friend of mine shared the following story with me, and I decided to share it here. As investors, we should learn from one another and understand the power of long-term holding.

Mike Markkula: Apple's first investor who would be worth $1 trillion today if he still had his Apple shares. Mike's story is fascinating.  
  
Markkula had an incredibly successful career as a marketing manager at Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, where he made millions from stock options, achieving financial independence by the age of 33. But his retirement was short-lived.  
  
In 1977, Markkula was introduced to two young entrepreneurs - Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. He invested in Apple $250,000 that year for 1/3 of the business.  
  
Mike essentially became a co-founder. And he actually acted like one. Markkula wrote the company's original business and marketing plans, which helped Apple become a Fortune 500 company, in just 5 years.  
  
He wrote several programs for the Apple II and beta-tested their hardware and software.  
  
Mike was the one who gave the go-ahead for the development of the Macintosh computer, which revolutionized personal computing with its graphical user interface.  
More importantly, he helped Jobs and Woz with crucial expertise and adult supervision when it was most needed.  
  
Markkula's biggest mistake? Not holding onto his Apple shares. He could have been the greatest VC of all time... but instead, he only got a great story for parties.",investing,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dqtfj3/apples_first_investor_story_power_of_long_term/,Apple,POSITIVE,0.9996191263198853

2024-07-15,1721052838.0,"Morgan Stanley names Apple as a ""top pick"" for AI efforts, raises price target from $216 to $273 ($4.2T market cap)","(Reuters) -Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a ""top pick,"" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

2024-02-02,1706842931.0,Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement later this year,"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.

While Cooks remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.

As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future, Cook said during a call with analysts. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and were excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.

Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developers conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase artificial intelligence during the presentation, preferring the more academic term machine learning.

Let me just say that I think theres a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself, Cook said.

The last 15 years have been an outlier. And despite high housing prices, people can obviously afford it and are buying, some with cash. Sure many Americans may be poorer but there are a lot more Americans with higher paying jobs and cash, especially in the cities and suburbs on the coasts. 

Apples stock price has barely dropped and still trades at a healthy $170 range. Apple and Microsoft make up the largest allocations of Spy and many many funds. People crying now are being ridiculous. The real pain wont start until Apple is at least down in the $150 range and things will be in full swing around $120 range. Same thing goes when Microsoft is under $230. 

When these two things happen, I think spy will drop to around $330-340 range. That will be the time to jump in with everything you have. Ill be buying TLT also then hopefully around $45.

And if we are just getting calculator apps, I think it's going to take a while - like their self-driving cars.

A friend has been with a wealth advisor (family/friend) for the last 10-15 years. The friend has asked many questions along the way but has always been counseled to stay cool and stick with the advisor. The wealth advisor is claiming a 6.76% return since 2012 (after fees) but refuses to address whether/why Vanguard funds seem to have a better track record. Instead, the wealth advisor continues to compare it's returns to that of a set of investments chosen by the wealth advisor as an alternative proving an above-market performance (i.e., in a seemingly straw man argument). Meanwhile, Vanguard funds seem to be way above this 6.76% return. 

The friend is not looking to become rich and famous here. Rather, a rational investment in hopes of a reasonable retirement is all that is sought. That is, what is sought is an apples-to-apples comparison of the returns that have been shown (6.76%) are comparable with returns that might be had from other widely available funds/indexes like those from Vanguard.

Higher tax rates are coming, and sooner or later the government is going to target 401k's and IRA's. The old adage of ""tax deferred when you are working so you can withdraw it and be taxed at a lower rate later"" is likely not true. We are, right now, likely in the lowest tax bracket we will ever be.

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

I personally think he sold them because he sees less growth in the future and to diversify his own single stock risk.

2024-05-15,1715806788.0,DD: Apple x OpenAI: The Worst Kept Secret Ever,"Hey WSB,

I've been doing some serious digging and speculating, and it looks like Apple is gearing up for a blockbuster announcement on June 10th. Heres why I believe a partnership with OpenAI is the worst kept secret of all time and why Im betting big on AAPL.

**1. Today's iOS18 Feature Announcements**

* Apple just dropped some semi-major features for iOS18: Accessibility improvements and new CarPlay options. Including controlling an iPad using only your eyes.
* These are important, but not exactly groundbreaking. It feels like theyre clearing the deck for something much bigger on June 10.

**2. ChatGPT 4o on Mac Desktop First**

* Despite Microsoft/Windows having equity in OpenAI, ChatGPT 4o was launched on Mac desktop first.
* Why would OpenAI prioritize Apple over their own investors unless there's a deeper partnership brewing?

**3. Key OpenAI Employees Bailing**

* Several key OpenAI employees have left in the past 48hours.
* It sounded like they were off-put or upset by some recent developments, and nothing would make you more upset as a revolutionary than working for the old guard imho.

**4. Media Leaks Leading Up to This**

* Various media leaks have been hinting at a big AI-related announcement from Apple. Apple themselves have signaled this is their big coming out party.
* These arent just rumors. Theyre too consistent and well-timed to be random.

**5. ChatGPT 4o vs. Siri**

* ChatGPT 4o is everything Siri is not. Its powerful, intuitive, and already works ""free"" on peoples iPhones.
* Imagine Apple integrating this level of AI into every iProduct. Both parties will make bank on every device sold from now onward and create the ultimate AI-driven hardware-software ecosystem.

**Conclusion**

* This partnership is a match made in heaven. The June 10 keynote is set to be an absolute blockbuster.
* For these reasons, Im all in on Apple.

**Counter Point:**

This is the worst kept secret ever and already baked in to the price.

2024-06-17,1718644573.0,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Fridays close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidias weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

Understanding how they might be weighted, where theyre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make whats beneath the label seem different from fund to fund, Bartolini said.

2024-04-30,1714456374.0,FT: Apple targets Google staff to build secret artificial intelligence team,"Financial Times analysis of hundreds of LinkedIn profiles as well as public job postings and research papers reveals that Apple has poached dozens of staff from Google in recent years to expand its global AI and Machine Learning team. The iPhone maker has attracted at least 36 specialists from its rival since it hired John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive in 2018.

Apple has also created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. Professor Luc Van Gool from Swiss university ETH Zurich said Apples acquisitions of two local AI start-ups  virtual reality group FaceShift and image recognition company Fashwell  led Apple to build a research laboratory, known as its Vision Lab, in the city.

Industry insiders suggest Apple is focused on deploying generative AI on its mobile devices, a breakthrough that would allow AI chatbots and apps to run on the phones own hardware and software rather than be powered by cloud services in data centres.

Apples top AI team is now made up of former key figures from Google, including Giannandrea, who previously oversaw Google Brain, the search companys AI lab which has since been merged DeepMind.

Samy Bengio, senior director of AI and ML research, was formerly one of Googles top AI scientists. Ruoming Pang, who leads Apples Foundation Models team working on large language models, previously led Googles AI speech recognition research.

The company also once hired Ian Goodfellow, another deep learning pioneer, but he returned to Google in 2022, protesting Apples return to work policy.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apples, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidias huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the companys overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apples sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidias stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

Apple said in a statement that the features  Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product  wont be available to EU customers due to Apples belief that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as gatekeepers in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the companys AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also wont be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

2024-07-29,1722261318.0,Apple to roll out artificial intelligence features in October ,"Apples new artificial intelligence features will roll out in October, missing the initial launch of iPhone and iPad software updates, according to a Bloomberg report released on Monday.

The company split the Apple Intelligence features from the initial iOS launch due to concerns over their stability and need to run tests on a wider scale, the report said. 

Apple previously said its AI features would be released in a beta version this fall, and theyre expected to help drive sales of Apples new iPhones. The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.

Apple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.

The company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls. 

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2024-03-04,1709557613.0,Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming,"The European Commission, the European Unions executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.

This is Apples first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.

The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.

Apples conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.

Apple response:

In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.

The primary advocate for this decision  and the biggest beneficiary  is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation, Apple said in a statement.

Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europes music streaming market  more than double their closest competitors  and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.

Apple said that a large part of Spotifys success is thanks to the Cupertino giants App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.

Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. Thats because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.

Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.

Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as gatekeepers under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.

The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.

The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies business practices.

These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

2024-03-05,1709664410.0,Whats the future of Apple?,"The world is going into the AI era, and I just dont see Apple in it.

It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its status symbol attribute too.
I dont see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads.
Apple Watch is like.. its a watch, they can improve on it, but I dont see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but thats it.
Macs arent going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but theres not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected.
Theres potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and its for sure they wont be the ones developing VR to that point.
Why? Well, thats my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to perfect it (even though they have massively failed many times).
Im just afraid they arent good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR.
My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because its something thats much harder to control, and perfect. I dont see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something thats not predictable.
For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something thats 5 years behind, but Im not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day).
They also dont have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do.
Im genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia.
Just to clarify, Im not anti Apple, Im the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), thats why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

2024-06-09,1717975081.0,Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?,"If youve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know its been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apples revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But heres the kicker: Apples earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apples revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apples rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apples AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Heres the play: Apples trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if youre looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

2024-06-11,1718119540.0,"Affirm buy now, pay later loans will be embedded into Apple Pay ","Apple device users will soon be able to tap into buy now, pay later loans from Affirm for purchases, the companies said Tuesday.

Affirm will surface as an option for U.S. Apple Pay users on iPhones and iPads later this year, the San Francisco-based fintech company said in a filing. Apple confirmed the news in its own update.

This provides users with additional payment choices, and offers the ease, convenience and security of Apple Pay alongside the features users love in Affirm  flexibility, transparency and no late or hidden fees, Affirm said in an email statement.

The move is a boost to Affirm and the buy now, pay later sector in general. When Apple introduced its own BNPL product last year, investors were concerned that the tech giant would crowd out standalone providers like Affirm. But the fact that Apple decided to also allow Affirm products in its ecosystem shows that the fintech company has something unique to offer.

For instance, while Apples BNPL loan lets users repay purchases in four installments over six weeks, Affirm has an array of longer-term offerings that can be repaid over a year or more. The companies didnt provide details on the terms of the new loans.

The bottom-line  in our view  is that Affirms strong brand and sophisticated underwriting technology have a moat that Apple likely could not replicate on its own, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev said in a research note.

Citi, Synchrony

Apple also said that installment loans via credit and debit cards would be available on Apple Pay in the U.S. with Citigroup, Synchrony and Fiserv-related issuers. Traditional credit-card players have begun offering BNPL-style installment loans after their popularity surged during the Covid pandemic.

Thanks to the ubiquity of the iPhone, Apple Pay has more than 500 million users around the world and a leading market share in the U.S. for its mobile payment and digital wallet platform.

Shares of Affirm rose 5% in early trading Tuesday, while shares of Apple were up about 5.3%.

Affirms stock rose despite the fact that the company indicated it would take time for the partnership to significantly boost its revenue.

Affirm does not expect this partnership to have a material impact on revenue or gross merchandise volume in fiscal year 2025, the company said in its filing.

2024-03-11,1710149633.0,Why Apple simply doesn't provide a cloud service?,"With AAPL growing now at what I consider to be a  ""GDP premium rate"" ~ 5% and with the iphone growth slowing down, what is left now for Apple is to capitalize on its services. This is now under attack in the EU. I am not a financial specialist but as a European I do however foresee a hard time for Apple to grow services revenue in the EU. Now that Apple has to offer search choices, that revenue with Google might also see some decline. With the self-driving car cancelled, it is hard to picture any sectors where Apple could still push double digit growth. VisionPro? too expensive at the moment, it would still to be at least in the $1000 range for the mass. While we have seen positive news on the tech, it is still unknown how many people who bought the device hasn't yet returned it.

GenAI? They reshuffled the entire team working on Titan to focus on GenAI. How is that possible? are the skills really transferable? Vision Problem != LLM but again not an expert.

This led me to wonder, why isn't Apple competing in the cloud business? I don't mean like AWS or Azure but for its developers? When a developer onboard on IOS, they make use of the store and the SDK but all cloud services the app uses is running somewhere else. Wouldn't Apple be able to justify 30%+ cut of the developer's revenue if part of the deal was access to Apple cloud infrastructure to run the App services?

Do you guys think this is far fetched? What other sectors do you guys think Apple can still tap in to to go back to double digit growth?

Leadership wise, i am a bit split. Post Steve Jobs, all they had truly done was innovate on the iPhone and in a way that phone was conceptualized during Steve's time. So what exactly did Tim Cook do? I would still pick Tim Cook over Sundar but he is not Satya who was more of an opportunist that turned Microsoft around.

2024-05-21,1716308932.0,"Comcast Reveals Pricing for Netflix, Peacock, Apple TV+ Bundle; $15/month","Comcast, as its legacy cable TV business continues to shrink, has built a new cable-style bundle for the streaming era.

Beginning next week, the cable giant will offer StreamSaver, a package that includes NBCUniversals Peacock Premium (with ads), Netflix Basic (with ads) and Apple TV+ for a discounted price, available to TV and broadband customers in its footprint.

As an add-on to Comcast TV or broadband, the StreamSaver bundle will cost $15 per month  a discount of at least 35% compared with price of the services purchased separately. In addition, Comcast will offer Netflix and Apple TV+ to its Now TV streaming-only service, which has Peacock and 40 free, ad-supported streaming TV channels, for $30 per month (versus $20/month without them).

Dave Watson, president and CEO of Comcast Cable, announced the details Tuesday at J.P. Morgans 2024 Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference.

These are three premium streaming services that are combined in one compelling package, Watson said, noting that StreamSaver is focused on boosting Comcasts broadband business. Its a home run for consumers& Were thrilled to have Netflix and Apple as partners.

On a standalone basis, the trio of services would cost $23-$25 per month: The ad-supported Peacock Premium is $5.99/month, going up to $7.99/month in July; Netflix Basic with ads costs $6.99/month; and the standard Apple TV+ plan at $9.99/month.

Watson said the priority for Comcast Cable is investing in the network for the long haul, in the anticipation that there will be more streaming, more consumption over time.

Comcast chief Brian Roberts first announced plans for StreamSaver one week ago at another investor conference. Weve been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years, and so this is the latest iteration of that, Roberts said. I think this will be a pretty compelling package.

Bundles aggregating streaming services from would-be competitors have gained new popularity among traditional media companies, which view them as a way to cut customer-acquisition costs and reduce churn (i.e., cancelation rates).

Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have announced a triple-play bundle comprising Max, Disney+ and Hulu, to be available starting this summer in the U.S. (with pricing yet to be announced). In addition, Venu Sports  a joint venture of Disney, WBD and Fox Corp.  anticipates launching a sports-centered live-streaming bundle in the fall of 2024, pending regulatory approval. Theres no word on pricing for Venu at this point.

Meanwhile, Disney offers discounted bundles with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ and has pushed to integrate them even more tightly together. Disney+ recently added a tile for Hulu (for customers with both services) and is using the tie-in to promote the bundle. In December, Disney+ will add a hub for ESPN+, providing some free games and programming to those who dont subscribe to the sports package in a bid to upsell them.

2024-04-30,1714456374.0,FT: Apple targets Google staff to build secret artificial intelligence team,"Financial Times analysis of hundreds of LinkedIn profiles as well as public job postings and research papers reveals that Apple has poached dozens of staff from Google in recent years to expand its global AI and Machine Learning team. The iPhone maker has attracted at least 36 specialists from its rival since it hired John Giannandrea to be its top AI executive in 2018.

Apple has also created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. Professor Luc Van Gool from Swiss university ETH Zurich said Apples acquisitions of two local AI start-ups  virtual reality group FaceShift and image recognition company Fashwell  led Apple to build a research laboratory, known as its Vision Lab, in the city.

Industry insiders suggest Apple is focused on deploying generative AI on its mobile devices, a breakthrough that would allow AI chatbots and apps to run on the phones own hardware and software rather than be powered by cloud services in data centres.

Apples top AI team is now made up of former key figures from Google, including Giannandrea, who previously oversaw Google Brain, the search companys AI lab which has since been merged DeepMind.

Samy Bengio, senior director of AI and ML research, was formerly one of Googles top AI scientists. Ruoming Pang, who leads Apples Foundation Models team working on large language models, previously led Googles AI speech recognition research.

The company also once hired Ian Goodfellow, another deep learning pioneer, but he returned to Google in 2022, protesting Apples return to work policy.

2024-02-02,1706842931.0,Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement later this year,"Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.

While Cooks remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.

As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future, Cook said during a call with analysts. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and were excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.

Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developers conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase artificial intelligence during the presentation, preferring the more academic term machine learning.

Let me just say that I think theres a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself, Cook said.

2024-05-02,1714681940.0,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the companys history, and a 22% increase over last years $90 billion authorization.  

Heres how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBCs Steve Kovach that overall sales would grow low single digits during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBCs Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

If you remove that $5 billion from last years results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis, Cook said. And so thats how we look at it internally from how the company is performing. 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last years increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segments high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the companys new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apples major product lines.  

Were only scratching the surface there so we couldnt be more excited about our opportunity there, Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has big plans to announce from an AI point of view during its iPad event next week as well as at the companys annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. Thats how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apples App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apples third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so, Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. That may come as a surprise to some people, Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apples $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apples previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

2024-05-04,1714826348.0,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13%,"Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the Oracle of Omaha continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.

In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshires biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.

This is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apples stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.

The Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshires cluster of insurers.

Many has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apples stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshires equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.

Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.

Its not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was probably a mistake. Also its not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.

Even with the sale, Berkshire is still Apples largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.

2024-05-07,1715091203.0,Apple announces new iPad Air tablets ,"Apple announced new versions of its iPad Air and iPad Pro tablet computers on Tuesday in a short video posted on its website.  

Apple said that it would come in two sizes: An 11-inch size, that matches older models, and a larger 13-inch model. Both are equipped with Apples M2 chip. The smaller iPad costs $599 for 128GB of storage, and the larger iPad starts at $799.

Apple has also moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device  landscape mode  to be better for videoconferencing, matching Apples more-expensive iPad Pro models.

These are the first new iPad models Apple has released since Oct. 2022, the longest time that Apple has gone without updating the product line since its launch in 2011. The iPad Air, Apples mid-tier model, was last updated in March 2022, and comes in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and a gold color.

It will be available in stores next week.

This is the biggest day for iPad since its introduction, Apple CEO Tim Cook said.

2024-05-11,1715393866.0,"Apple nears deal with OpenAI to power upcoming iPhone features with ChatGPT, says Bloomberg","After talking with both OpenAI and Google about their AI models, Apple is nearing a deal to partner with OpenAI and leverage ChatGPT for upcoming iPhone features, reports Bloomberg. We can expect to see the workings of both companies as soon as next month, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

According to Mark Gurman, who spoke with ""people familiar with the matter,"" Apple first renewed talks with OpenAI to use the startup's tech to power new AI features coming to future iPhones, and is now nearing a formal partnership. 

This comes shortly after Apple was reportedly in talks with Google to license Gemini for various iPhone services. ""Those discussions haven't led to an agreement, but are ongoing,"" says Gurman.

The news comes shortly after OpenAI announced it would be unveiling new ChatGPT features this upcoming Monday, a day before Google I/O. Talks between the Microsoft-backed AI company and Apple were apparently pretty far along, Bloomberg previously reported, as discussions of an agreement had occurred for some time.

While Apple has plenty of researchers working on the company's own AI models, those don't seem quite ready to be the star of the show, so the company has been looking for outside help.

The next big iPhone update, iOS 18, will most likely be announced during WWDC on June 10. With Apple nearing a deal with OpenAI, we may see some familiar ChatGPT capabilities integrated across popular iOS features like iMessage, FaceTime, and, of course, Siri.

It's worth pointing out that OpenAI's ChatGPT app came to the iPhone about two months before landing on Android. Apple hasn't officially announced any AI features for the iPhone, but if you look at the Pixel 8 Pro or the Galaxy S24, you can get an idea of what the new features might be: generative AI photo editing, transcription of voice memos, webpage summarization, text generation, custom wallpapers, and so on.

There aren't any details about what iPhone models the new AI might be available on, but if Apple follows its competitors, the features will likely debut on the newest flagship and slowly trickle down to other models.

2024-05-14,1715695575.0,"Comcast offers subscribers Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ bundle","Comcast said Tuesday it will introduce a streaming bundle for its cable, broadband and mobile subscribers, tying together Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ at a discounted rate.

The announcement, made Tuesday at the MoffettNathanson media conference in New York, comes as major media players increasingly join forces to drive value for users and subscriptions for streaming services.

On May 8, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a bundle of its streaming services  Disney+, Hulu and Max.

Comcasts offer follows a model similar to several bundles from Verizon: Its streaming bundle will be offered to existing Comcast subscribers, which could help prop up its pay-TV subscribers.

The company lost 487,000 cable TV customers during the first quarter, Comcast reported during earnings on April 25. The companys wireless business, however, saw a 21% jump in customers to 6.9 million total lines.

Comcast did not disclose the price of the upcoming bundle. Peacock subscription plans start at $5.99 per month, though thats increasing to $7.99 per month this summer. Comcast broadband customers typically receive a discount on the companys streaming service.

Netflix plans start at $6.99 per month, and Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month.

Apple has been investing a lot in artificial intelligence recently, and soon the company will introduce its own generative AI to the world. In fact, it looks like the company is taking AI seriously, as a new report claims that Apple is developing a new chip specifically to power AI processing data centers.

A report by the Wall Street Journal says that the company is building AI chips for data centers, potentially to run some of its new AI-based features to be announced at WWDC 2024 next month.

Apple has been working on its own chip designed to run artificial intelligence software in data center servers, a move that has the potential to provide the company with a key advantage in the AI arms race, Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie told the WSJ, citing sources familiar with the matter. The project is known as ACDC  for Apple Chips in Data Center.
The report comes after analyst Jeff Pu of Haitong International Securities said this week that Apple is using both M2 Ultra and M4 chips to power servers dedicated to iOS 18s new AI-based features.

The company is expected to introduce many features based on generative AI with iOS 18 and other software updates to be announced in June at WWDC 2024. Apple has also been developing its own language models that can run offline. However, these models are more limited, so having online alternatives would be ideal for providing more accurate results.
Interestingly, previous reports have revealed that Apple has been in discussions with both OpenAI and Google to use their AI technologies in iOS 18.

2024-03-04,1709557613.0,Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming,"The European Commission, the European Unions executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.

This is Apples first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.

The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.

Apples conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.

Apple response:

In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.

The primary advocate for this decision  and the biggest beneficiary  is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation, Apple said in a statement.

Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europes music streaming market  more than double their closest competitors  and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.

Apple said that a large part of Spotifys success is thanks to the Cupertino giants App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.

Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. Thats because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.

Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.

Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as gatekeepers under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.

The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.

The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies business practices.

These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

2024-03-05,1709664410.0,Whats the future of Apple?,"The world is going into the AI era, and I just dont see Apple in it.

It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its status symbol attribute too.
I dont see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads.
Apple Watch is like.. its a watch, they can improve on it, but I dont see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but thats it.
Macs arent going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but theres not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected.
Theres potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and its for sure they wont be the ones developing VR to that point.
Why? Well, thats my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to perfect it (even though they have massively failed many times).
Im just afraid they arent good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR.
My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because its something thats much harder to control, and perfect. I dont see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something thats not predictable.
For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something thats 5 years behind, but Im not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day).
They also dont have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do.
Im genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia.
Just to clarify, Im not anti Apple, Im the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), thats why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

This is now under attack in the EU. I am not a financial specialist but as a European I do however foresee a hard time for Apple to grow services revenue in the EU. Now that Apple has to offer search choices, that revenue with Google might also see some decline. With the self-driving car cancelled, it is hard to picture any sectors where Apple could still push double digit growth. VisionPro? too expensive at the moment, it would still to be at least in the $1000 range for the mass. While we have seen positive news on the tech, it is still unknown how many people who bought the device hasn't yet returned it.

GenAI? They reshuffled the entire team working on Titan to focus on GenAI. How is that possible? are the skills really transferable? Vision Problem != LLM but again not an expert.

This led me to wonder, why isn't Apple competing in the cloud business? I don't mean like AWS or Azure but for its developers? When a developer onboard on IOS, they make use of the store and the SDK but all cloud services the app uses is running somewhere else. Wouldn't Apple be able to justify 30%+ cut of the developer's revenue if part of the deal was access to Apple cloud infrastructure to run the App services?

Do you guys think this is far fetched? What other sectors do you guys think Apple can still tap in to to go back to double digit growth?

Leadership wise, i am a bit split. Post Steve Jobs, all they had truly done was innovate on the iPhone and in a way that phone was conceptualized during Steve's time. So what exactly did Tim Cook do?

According to Bloomberg, there are active negotiations to let Apple license Gemini, Googles set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the iPhone software this year. Apple has also talked with OpenAI, which powers Microsofts AI capabilities.
Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with todays report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release.
The discussions are still underway, and its unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship  default search engine  between the two companies.
Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.

2023-09-29,1695974436.0,Microsoft Reportedly Tried to Sell Bing to Apple in 2020,"Microsoft executives tried to sell the companys Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, pitching the deal as a way for the iPhone maker to replace Google as the default search engine in Apples Safari browser, Bloomberg reported. The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.

The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Googles deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsofts alleged sale effort appears to bolster the governments contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the worlds most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Fridays close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidias weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

Understanding how they might be weighted, where theyre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make whats beneath the label seem different from fund to fund, Bartolini said.

The move comes after Apple said it would start allowing installment loans later this year in its Apple Pay checkout process through third-party companies, such as Affirm, and credit and debit cards from issuers, such as Citigroup.

Apple said it would no longer issue Apple Pay Later loans, which enabled customers to buy products online and pay in four interest-free installments, at prices up to $1,000. The discontinuation is a sign that not every new fintech feature or product that Apple launches becomes a success or fits in with the iPhone makers overall strategy.

Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay, an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.

Apple said users who wanted installment plans at checkout would gain access to them through other financial intermediaries in more countries around the world than they would with Apple Pay Later, which was only available in the U.S.

Apple said its priority with Apple Pay, the brand name for its contactless and online payment software, was to enable secure and private payments. Users with open loans will continue to have access to Apple Pay Later features to manage and pay their loans, Apple said.

Before it was discontinued, Apple Pay Later enabled users to apply for loans within the iPhone Wallet app, and approved users would see a Pay Later option when checking out online.

The process notably involved Apple taking over more of the financial backend than some of its other products, like Apple Card. For the program, Apple made some of its own credit credit checks and loan decisions, instead of having those handled entirely through financial partners. Apples loans were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary.

2) Apple is going to lose out on millions of users to train their own algorithms for SIRI,  which has been one of their few areas for innovation and proprietary growth

*update: to add some context, I'm aware of the Apple Intelligence features, but the worry is that they are giving the difficult tasks to OpenAi, which means a billion active users to train data that wont be used for the things that Siri is less-capable in.

This means they will likely be outpaced further by OpenAi in the future, and lose the advantage of being a strong competitor in this market (of AI)

2024-06-22,1719076360.0,"Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ","Apple said Friday it wont release three recently announced features, including its flagship Apple Intelligence AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to regulatory uncertainties stemming from the blocs Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.

Apple said in a statement that the features  Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product  wont be available to EU customers due to Apples belief that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as gatekeepers in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the companys AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also wont be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.

According to Bloomberg, there are active negotiations to let Apple license Gemini, Googles set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the iPhone software this year. Apple has also talked with OpenAI, which powers Microsofts AI capabilities.
Apple is specifically looking to partner on cloud-based generative AI, with todays report citing text and image generation as examples of what Gemini could be used for. At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release.
The discussions are still underway, and its unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship  default search engine  between the two companies.
Looking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.
Google offers Gemini in three sizes, with Pro being used by most first and third-party apps.

While Cooks remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.

As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future, Cook said during a call with analysts. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and were excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.

Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developers conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase artificial intelligence during the presentation, preferring the more academic term machine learning.

Let me just say that I think theres a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself, Cook said.

2024-03-05,1709664410.0,Whats the future of Apple?,"The world is going into the AI era, and I just dont see Apple in it.

It seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its status symbol attribute too.
I dont see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads.
Apple Watch is like.. its a watch, they can improve on it, but I dont see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but thats it.
Macs arent going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but theres not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected.
Theres potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and its for sure they wont be the ones developing VR to that point.
Why? Well, thats my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to perfect it (even though they have massively failed many times).
Im just afraid they arent good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR.
My theory is they will be afraid of AI, because its something thats much harder to control, and perfect. I dont see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something thats not predictable.
For VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something thats 5 years behind, but Im not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day).
They also dont have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do.
Im genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia.
Just to clarify, Im not anti Apple, Im the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), thats why I see they are getting less and less exciting.

2024-03-21,1711031573.0,DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its astronomical valuation at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.

Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apples anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apples advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.

Each step in Apples course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly, the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.

The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.

The challenge represents a significant risk to Apples walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.

The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the companys $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.

If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.

This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Applewhere hardware, software, and services intersect, an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing peoples technology.

The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apples business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.

This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apples monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible, the complaint said.

iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming

The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.

Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.

Not to make it personal but I cant send my mom certain videos, the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.

Buy your mom an iPhone, Cook responded.

The DOJ is also focusing on Apples smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The companys decision means that users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones, according to the complaint.

The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.

Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.

Todays lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.

The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether its complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.

Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.

Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

Apple isnt the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The companys shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Unions executive arm, opened an investigation into Apples tax payments in Ireland, the tech giants headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received illegal tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commissions decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EUs second-highest court anulled the Commissions 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Courts decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EUs crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EUs sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

**Here's why:**

* It's VERY fast and now multimodal. It can ""see"" the world around you. Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) says it is the best interface he's ever used. He said, ""It feels like AI from the movies,"" and he's not wrong. It's magic. You can ask it to look around you and solve math equations, offer outfit suggestions, help you figure out who and what you're looking at, and more. The demos that they [showcased today during their livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?si=WR9xjFTpltNX1Ptc) were magical.
* It can help you navigate the world and physical spaces. This is something that Meta, Humane, and Rabbit have been trying to do with their multi-modal devices ([Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses), [Humane AI Pin](https://humane.com/), [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/)).
* It has improved memory and remembers context and details about you, what you do, and what you ask it to do. It's like having a deeply personalized personal assistant. Think Jarvis in Iron Man.
* It sounds NATURAL and, more importantly, reacts naturally. You can interrupt it mid-sentence, and it'll stop to listen to you, just like a real human. It's akin to the movie ""Her"". There's a reason they made the default voice sound like Scarlett Johansson.
* They've announced an exclusive MacOS app that integrates seamlessly into your workflow and allows you to upload screenshots to offer feedback on coding or your writing; you can voice chat with it and also have it summarize notes/ meetings. Nothing for windows yet.
* Siri is terrible as it currently stands. We have a ton of anecdotal evidence. Just look at r/iphone or any discussion around why [Siri has gotten worse over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/169l5o6/siri_is_more_than_useless_at_this_point/). It's no secret that Amazon and Google have proven that their assistants are better in many ways, but they don't have the Apple ecosystem. This is the only reason Siri is remotely tolerable.
* The [2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/) is happening in a little under a month, from June 10th - June 14th. They will be announcing the new features and direction for iOS18. Tim Cook stated on their recent earnings call, ""We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apples unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration.
* Apple scrapped its semi-autonomous electric vehicle project and re-focused on AI [about two months ago](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-scraps-ev-plans-highlighting-shifting-focus-on-ai-8601590).
* Bloomberg released this article on Friday. [Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone?embedded-checkout=true). In it, they state that ""The two sides have been finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apples iOS 18, the next iPhone operating system"".
* Forbes posted this earlier today: [Apples New ChatGPT DealHeres What It Means For iPhone Security. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/05/13/apples-new-chatgpt-deal-heres-what-it-means-for-your-iphone/?sh=68e0793e583e)

I think we're at a pivotal time in tech with AI large language models, which are finally getting to the point where they are refined and fast enough to be harnessed for general-use cases. With its seamless tech, Apple will ride this wave and finally make Siri the magical assistant that it was always supposed to be.

\*\*My position is 600 shares bought at an average cost of $186.10, bought right at market close today. I'm planning on holding them long-term. Tomorrow, I'll purchase some long-dated calls. Roast me all you want. I wanted to make sure I had all of my analysis squared away before I bought in.

And if that man sells Apple at some point in the future he will be greatly criztied for trimming one of Buffet's largest holdings. He is leaving him a large cash fund to be able to buy the companies he wants and not be critiqued for having to liquidate Buffet and Mungers previous picks.

2024-05-25,1716668669.0,"Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its manufacturing capacity","Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market.

According to [9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/20/secret-meeting-between-apple-and-tsmc-reported-possibly-to-reserve-all-2nm-capacity/) (via [Extreme tech](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/report-apple-met-with-tsmc-to-secure-all-of-its-upcoming-2nm-capacity)), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise.

[TSMC's 2nm process](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmcs-upcoming-2nm-chip-tech-could-make-for-incredibly-fast-but-painfully-pricey-graphics-cards/) is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology.

The specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that [Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity](https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-books-exclusive-access-to-tsmcs-3nm-chipmaking-capacity-for-a-whole-year/), at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising.

It's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumptionif not both.

Samsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple.

It's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.

Maestri will continue to lead teams focusing on IT, security, and real estate development, Apple said. He had been Apple CFO since 2014.

Parekh, the incoming CFO, has been on Maestris finance leadership team for years as the companys VP of Financial Planning and Analysis.

For more than a decade, Kevan has been an indispensable member of Apples finance leadership team, and he understands the company inside and out. His sharp intellect, wise judgment, and financial brilliance make him the perfect choice to be Apples next CFO, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

Maestri was named Apple CFO in 2014, before the stock began a torrid run, partially powered by strong demand for iPhones. He oversaw Apples record-breaking capital return program, and appeared alongside Cook on quarterly earnings calls.

In 2014, Apples annual sales were about $183 billion. Last year, Apple reported $383 billion in revenue. Apple stock is up over 800% since Maestri became CFO.

This week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.

Yet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.

Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, +8.56% was a hot company around the turn of the century, as it leapt ahead in the fast-moving race to sell personal computers. The company became the top-selling computer-systems provider globally in 2001.

The brand lost some of its cachet as the years went on, and as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% began to see more traction in the personal-computer market. But Dell seems cool again in the artificial-intelligence era, and investors are taking notice.

The stock closed up 8.6% in Wednesday trading to hit $128.58. That marked a new all-time closing high for the shares, their first in about a month.

Read: Apples stock has faltered, but a Steve Jobs moment in AI may be on the horizon

Dells stock has enjoyed an explosive recent run, rising 67% so far in 2024 and advancing 214% over the past year. And its performance over a longer span as been notable as well, especially on a relative basis: Dell shares are up 309% over a five-year period, while Apples stock is ahead 245%.

Wall Street has a new appreciation for Dell thanks to the companys position as a backbone of the AI revolution. The shares enjoyed their best day on record in early March, as the company showed rapid shipment growth for its AI-optimized servers. AI-hardware titan Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.55% even gave Dell a prominent shoutout at its recent GTC developer event.

While the company has been through prior technology cycles (server virtualization, public cloud, mobile, etc.), one key difference for AI is that it appears to be incremental to the total addressable market, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a mid-March note to clients. Earlier shifts in the tech landscape meant that newer technologies displaced legacy ones to an extent, he added.

2024-08-01,1722544422.0,"Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump","Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Heres how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated 

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apples most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the companys total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so thats sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBCs Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesnt know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

What weve done is weve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things, Cook said. From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners financials, and we would be paying expense. 

Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount were spending for AI and Apple intelligence, Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers havent owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apples Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under Wearables, Home, and Accessories. Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, were still growing that base significantly, Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the companys content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apples forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apples active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apples App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base, Cook said. Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year. 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

2024-03-25,1711362402.0,"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law","The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.

Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabets rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apples rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Metas pay or consent model, the Commission said in a statement.

The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called anti-steering rules. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

The way that Apple and Alphabets implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.

Apple has already fallen foul of the EUs rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabets display of Google search results may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Googles other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.

The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.

The Commission said that it is concerned that Apples measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.

The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called pay and consent model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.

The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Metas pay or consent model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.

Thierry Breton, the EUs internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be free alternative options offered by Meta for its services that are less personalized.

Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.

 We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA, Vestager said.

The long-awaited lawsuit is a watershed moment for Apple. For years it was one of the few Big Tech companies to avoid major antitrust action by the US. Now it is under intense scrutiny from regulators in two of its key markets, the US and the EU. Its responses have indicated it is steeling itself for an existential battle.  


Apple said the US case threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. A loss would set a dangerous precedent by allowing the government to influence how technology markets developed, it added.  


The new US lawsuit is broad and detailed, painting a picture of a company that has spent years knowingly heading off competitive threats to its ecosystem, be it on the App Store, in messaging with rival Android phones, on its tap to pay service, or in the smartwatch market.

2024-03-21,1711031573.0,DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly,"The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its astronomical valuation at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.

Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apples anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apples advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.

Each step in Apples course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly, the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.

The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.

The challenge represents a significant risk to Apples walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.

The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the companys $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.

If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.

Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.

This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Applewhere hardware, software, and services intersect, an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing peoples technology.

The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apples business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.

This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apples monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible, the complaint said.

iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming

The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.

Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.

Not to make it personal but I cant send my mom certain videos, the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.

Buy your mom an iPhone, Cook responded.

The DOJ is also focusing on Apples smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The companys decision means that users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones, according to the complaint.

The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.

Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.

Todays lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.

The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether its complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.

Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.

Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

Apple isnt the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.

It is not clear what the focus of the charges would be, but makers of hardware devices, like smart-tracker maker Tile, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.

Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.

Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker.

A new antitrust suit against Apple would be the third by the Justice Department in the past 14 years, but it is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, Bloomberg reported.

s new sleep apnea detection feature for use, which means it will come to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 later this month. 

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a persons breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. 

We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea, Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the features launch video.

Apples sleep apnea detection feature marks the companys latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. 

To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where theyre monitored overnight.

I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.

The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.

2024-04-18,1713473517.0,"Metas new AI assistant is rolling out across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger","Meta
 on Thursday announced its free artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, is rolling out across its social media platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The assistant can answer questions, create animations and generate images, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video. Meta AI was built on the companys latest large language model called Meta Llama 3, which was also announced Thursday.

The AI tool is Metas competitor to OpenAIs ChatGPT and Google
 Gemini but, in a unique twist, Meta has also partnered with Google and Microsoft
 to provide results from both companies search engines.

We believe that Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the video.

Shares of Meta closed up more than 1% Thursday.

Meta AI is built into the search box of the WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger apps so users can easily ask questions that can be answered through the new tool.

For instance, the company said users can ask Meta AI for restaurant recommendations, help planning a vacation or inspiration to decorate a new apartment.

Meta AI is also available on the website meta.ai, where users can ask the assistant for help with tasks like solving a math problem or writing a professional email, according to the release. Users can log their conversations for future reference.

Meta said the assistants image-generation feature will be available in beta on WhatsApp and the MetaAI website. Users will see an image appear as they start typing and MetaAI will provide prompts to help change or refine the image. The images can also be animated into a GIF that users can share.

Meta first introduced Meta AI in beta at its Connect event in September. The assistant is rolling out in English across more than a dozen countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Australia, starting Thursday.

2024-07-28,1722177207.0,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why.,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

2024-09-12,1726171343.0,Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

2024-06-04,1717480033.0,"Google cuts at least 100 jobs across fast-growing cloud unit, sources say","Alphabet is laying off employees from several teams in Googles cloud unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses, CNBC has learned.

The company notified employees last week of the cloud cuts, with roles being eliminated in sales, consulting, go to market strategy, operations and engineering, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. At least 100 positions were cut, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they werent authorized to speak about the layoffs.

Insider previously reported some details of the layoffs.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC the cuts are incremental across teams to better align its go to market organization.

As weve shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers priorities and the significant opportunity ahead, the spokesperson said. We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.

Some of those who lost their jobs had worked on the companys annual Google Cloud Next that took place mid April, said people familiar with the situation.

Google has been conducting ongoing layoffs since early 2023. Employees have since complained about demands that they work on tighter deadlines with fewer resources and diminished opportunities for internal advancement even as the company records record profit.

Last month, Google cut at least 200 employees from its Core organization, which included key teams and engineering talent. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that the company would make fewer layoffs in the second half of 2024.

Revenue in Google Cloud, which houses much of the companys AI technology, jumped 28% from a year earlier to $9.57 billion in the latest quarter, sailing past estimates. Operating income more than quadrupled to $900 million, showing that Google is finally generating substantial profits after pouring money into the business for years to keep up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

However, the cloud unit, led by CEO Thomas Kurian, has been under pressure to continue accelerating growth as competition heats up in AI.

2024-05-29,1716943673.0,HubSpot shares jump on talks of potential Google deal  ,"HubSpot shares rallied 8% on Tuesday after CNBCs David Faber reported that Alphabet is looking at an all-stock offer for the software company.

Reports of a potential deal first surfaced in early April, when Reuters published a story saying Alphabet was talking to advisors about making an offer for HubSpot. Bloomberg followed with a story earlier this month, indicating that talks were progressing.

There have been many reports about HubSpot being in conversations with Google, Faber said Tuesday. My understanding is absolutely true, all-stock deal for Alphabet to acquire HubSpot.

With a market cap of about $33 billion, after Tuesdays jump, HubSpot would be by far Alphabets largest deal ever. Googles biggest acquisition to date was the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility in 2011.

HubSpot is primarily used for marketing by small- and medium-size businesses. Its products would presumably fill a gap in helping Google provide marketing technology and customer relationship management tools to its customers, potentially bolstering cloud revenue.

HubSpot shares were up slightly for the year prior to Tuesdays gains, closing the day at $638.39. The stock doubled in value in 2023.

Alphabet did not immediately respond to CNBCs request for comment. HubSpot declined to comment.

2024-02-08,1707406479.0,Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription,"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAIs ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Googles rebrand and app offerings underline the companys commitment to pursuing  and investing heavily in  AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firms commitment to AI during the companys Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a users behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is a lot of execution ahead. Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Googles Gemini changes are a first step to building a true AI assistant, Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Googles most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the companys paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. Theres also a two-month free trial available.

Thursdays rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but theyre restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Googles former name for the packaged AI agents within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI subscription will also have access to Geminis assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Googles Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that its about helping users understand that theyre interacting directly with the AI models that underpin the chatbot.

Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models, Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyones calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard, Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.

2024-05-14,1715709586.0,Google rolls out its most powerful AI models as competition from OpenAI heats up ,"Google is using its annual developer conference to showcase what the company is calling its lightest and most efficient artificial intelligence models.

At Google I/O on Tuesday, the company announced Gemini 1.5 Flash, the newest addition to the Gemini model series.

We heard from developers that they wanted something faster and even more cost effective, said Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, in a press briefing.

The unveiling comes as tech companies increasingly refocus their product development and rollouts around generative AI, which is of particular importance to Google because the new tools give consumers more advanced and creative ways to access online information compared to traditional web search.

OpenAI on Monday launched a new AI model and desktop version of ChatGPT, along with a new user interface. The new model, GPT-4o, is twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo and half the cost, the company said.

Google also announced an improved Gemini 1.5 Pro model, which has the ability to make sense of multiple large documents  1,500-pages total  or summarize 100 emails, according to a vice president working on Gemini.

Gemini 1.5 Pro will soon be able to handle an hour of video content, or codebases with more than 30,000 lines, Hsiao said.

You can quickly get answers and insights about dense documents, like figuring out the details of the pet policy in your rental agreement or comparing key arguments of multiple long research papers, Hsiao said.

OpenAIs latest upgrade, announced this week, brings with it improved quality and speed of ChatGPT for 50 different languages. It will also be available via OpenAIs application programming interface (API), allowing developers to begin building applications using the new model immediately, executives said.

With 35 languages, Google says Gemini 1.5 Pro has a 2 million token window, which measures context and indicates how much information the model is able to process at once. The new model has improved local reasoning, planning and image understanding, company executives said.

It offers the longest context window of any foundational model yet, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the press briefing. At the event, he gave an example of a parent asking Gemini to summarize all recent emails from their childs school. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro will initially be available for testing in Workspace Labs. Gemini 1.5 Flash will be available for testing and in Vertex AI, which is Googles machine learning platform that lets developers train and deploy AI applications.

Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the companys worldwide employee base.

The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the companys thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.

Wizs cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response  a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.

CNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.

The company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. Its backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Google successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Googles largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. As recently as last week, Google reportedly ended conversations to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.

2024-04-30,1714447561.0,"Google lays off staff from Flutter, Dart and Python teams weeks before its developer conference","Ahead of Googles annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go.

As weve said, were responsibly investing in our companys biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead, said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, were simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers, he added.

The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, were told.

In one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected a LOT of teams, and that lots of great projects lost people.

Were sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond, wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart werent affected any more or less than other teams. We know yall care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem weve built together. Youre nervous. I get it. We get it. Youre betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google, he said.

Google also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year.

In a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were multiple current and former core devs and steering council members, they said.

Meanwhile, others shared on Y Combinators Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy.

[D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the marathon, not sprint approach to work. As I said in another comment, its the best job Ive ever had, and Ill miss it deeply, they wrote.

Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team, the user, gpshead, also said.

Though Google didnt detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.

On social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didnt eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich  at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday.

Its a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off  excuse me, had their roles reduced, and youre asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it, he said.

Google said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.

2024-06-11,1718137074.0,Oracle shares jump on Google and OpenAI deals despite earnings miss ,"Oracle shares moved 9% higher in extended trading on Tuesday after the company announced cloud deals with Google and OpenAI, despite fourth-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street expectations.

Heres how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $14.29 billion, vs. $14.55 billion expected

Oracles revenue increased 3% year over year during the quarter, which ended on May 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share, was down from $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The cloud services and license support segment generated $10.23 billion in revenue, up 9% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $10.29 billion.

The companys cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.84 billion in revenue. Thats down 15% and lower than the $2.09 billion StreetAccount consensus.

Cloud infrastructure revenue came to $2.0 billion, up 42%, which was a deceleration from the 49% growth rate in the prior quarter. The cloud business remains smaller than rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but is growing faster.

Oracle said in a statement on Tuesday that it would bring its database to Googles cloud, with availability coming in November. In an additional statement, Oracle said OpenAI has selected the Oracle public cloud to extend Microsofts AI infrastructure.

During the quarter, Oracle said its database software would be available in five additional Microsoft Azure data center regions, bringing the total to 15. Oracle also announced generative artificial intelligence features coming to its Fusion cloud applications for supply chain and human resources.

2024-04-09,1712686226.0,Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ,"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.

With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.

Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.

Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem, Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.

Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.

Arm isnt completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Amperes Arm-based chips earlier this year.

Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazons claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common x86 model used by AMD and Intel processors.

Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.

Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.

Broader use of chips drawing on Arms architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.

The chips can also speed up applications.

Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.

I think it completes their portfolio, Dekate said.

Google is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The people familiar told the Journal that a deal could come soon. Wiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.

Wizs cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into the companys full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

If completed, the deal would be Googles largest ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago. But the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny.

2024-06-04,1717480033.0,"Google cuts at least 100 jobs across fast-growing cloud unit, sources say","Alphabet is laying off employees from several teams in Googles cloud unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses, CNBC has learned.

The company notified employees last week of the cloud cuts, with roles being eliminated in sales, consulting, go to market strategy, operations and engineering, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. At least 100 positions were cut, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they werent authorized to speak about the layoffs.

Insider previously reported some details of the layoffs.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC the cuts are incremental across teams to better align its go to market organization.

As weve shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers priorities and the significant opportunity ahead, the spokesperson said. We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.

Some of those who lost their jobs had worked on the companys annual Google Cloud Next that took place mid April, said people familiar with the situation.

Google has been conducting ongoing layoffs since early 2023. Employees have since complained about demands that they work on tighter deadlines with fewer resources and diminished opportunities for internal advancement even as the company records record profit.

Last month, Google cut at least 200 employees from its Core organization, which included key teams and engineering talent. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that the company would make fewer layoffs in the second half of 2024.

Revenue in Google Cloud, which houses much of the companys AI technology, jumped 28% from a year earlier to $9.57 billion in the latest quarter, sailing past estimates. Operating income more than quadrupled to $900 million, showing that Google is finally generating substantial profits after pouring money into the business for years to keep up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

However, the cloud unit, led by CEO Thomas Kurian, has been under pressure to continue accelerating growth as competition heats up in AI.

2024-05-13,1715640578.0,My thoughts about Google and their potential threat from AI search engines,"Hi all, I have seen a few comments on Reddit and YouTube regarding Google and their future. As you all know the competition in the search space is getting more competitive as companies trying to get a slice of that ad money. Meanwhile search bots have proven to be useful in many instances. 

As many bear cases have been written all over the internet, I will focus on the bull cases. I will share my top ten with you, and I promise you, this is fully written by myself without the help of AI. You will believe me as my English grammar is bad AF.

Let me give you first an overview about Google revenue streams by percentage:

57% Google Search ads, 10.3% YouTube Ads, 10.2% Google network ads, 11.3% Subscriptions and devices, 10.8% Google Cloud, Rest Are other bets. 

Of course Google search makes up a huge chunk of the revenue and even more of the profits. But I think what many people are missing in many of the discussions about Google is:

1. Google will not lose their 90% market share over night IF at all. It will be years until the majority of people will even notice that there are other options now. They know about ChatGPT and are still googling.

2. Regarding to Statcounter Google had 91.8% market share in January 2021. Now after ChatGPT and MS Copilot and whatever, Google stands at 90.9%. This is so little change, that we cannot even speak about a trend at the moment. 

3. IF Google is going to lose substantial market share it wont go to zero. People are often pretending like Google is going to be irrelevant and losing all business. Not going to happen, Bing and DuckDuckGo existing during Googles dominance proves this. 

4. `The minimum market share will always be the Android users. As Google will be defaulted with Android and Chrome devices. As long as the Apple Safari deal is legal and active the minimum base for Google is HUGE. I cant see people changing the standard search engine pro actively, especially if its what they know - Google. That something like Bing even has market share at all, shows that people are likely to stay with the default. That is not an insult from my side this is an argument from Satya Nadella himself, made in court. At the moment, IF they change the default, they are more likely to switch from Bing to Google, than from Google to Bing. Additionally I think you can also add Google cloud business customer to this baseline.

5. That means advertiser will continue to pump money into Google search. Even if their market share goes down to 50-70%(very conservatively). They will very likely remain the number 1 search engine for a very long time. A few anecdotal tech bubble guys are not representative for changing the habits of billions of people. And with more people getting access to internet, the market as a whole will continue to grow.

6. `Google does not only have the number 1 search engine, they also have number 2 with YouTube. YouTube is also getting a lot of advertising money and is still growing double digits.

7. Even if Google search money stops to grow or would decline, you have to look out for, if it would decline faster than the other segments will grow. If its flat or declining like 1-2% a year while Cloud and YouTube and Networks are growing double digits, Google will still generate Billions of cash flow a quarter. Similar to the current state of Apple with their IPhone sales.

8. Googles businesses are alle potential high margin businesses and are still growing double digits. Of course search is the number 1 but the other businesses would also be worth 100s of billions on their own.

9. I dont see the threat of Google getting broken up by the authorities. You cannot made a bear case for both. Either they have monopoly that needs to be broken up, or they are threatened by AI companies. You cannot make a case for both at the same time imho. But even if they are getting punished or broken up, this will take YEARS in courts and after that they will be appeals by Google which will also take years. Until then there is a chance that Google businesses are more worth broken up in parts anyway. I see that very relaxed.

10. All of this doesnt factor in any bets (like Waymo or their 8% SpaceX stake) that could take off or anything they are doing with Deepmind and AI which is a potential upside imho.

Google will be fine. Why I think YouTube, Networks, Cloud and other businesses are too businesses that will continue to grow would take another 100000 words and I think there are enough sources and analysis for that. So thats it from my side, would love a positive vibes discussion.

Long story short: They could have some short term struggles due to sentiment and temporary revenue and profit lost. But they will be fine long term.",stocks,71.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1crcwf3/my_thoughts_about_google_and_their_potential/,Google,POSITIVE,0.9913100004196167

* Feds [charged employees](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805651/000162828024009544/marketwiseinc4q2023quarter.htm) of a (former) subsidiary for accepting payments to recommend specific shitco stocks.
* MarketWise [wound down](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/marketwise-to-cut-104-jobs-as-misconduct-prompts-wind-down-of-legacy-research-0b7fc481) that entire operational arm, cutting 18% of its workforce.
* In the midst of all that, founder Porter Stansberry [came back](https://investors.marketwise.com/news-releases/news-release-details/marketwise-announces-leadership-changes-strengthen-operations) as Chairman/CEO to presumably sort everything out and realign the business.

Got it? There's more there but it's confusing and not super relevant anyway.

MarketWise is a pretty classic stock/finance/investing media company - think Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool, etc, except MarketWise owns a bunch of properties that generally exist to provide free investment content to funnel readers to pay for ""premium"" tiered stuff.

One of MarketWise's most well-known properties is InvestorPlace, which is a veritable content factory - Google any stock, investing phrase, or whatever and you'll probably see an InvestorPlace article near the top of the list as a news item. I just tested it with ""Stocks to Buy"" and InvestorPlace had 3 items in the news feed right up top. Clearly influential and pointing to a possible reversal of fortunes, right?

Maybe not. It's pretty clear from even a little digging that InvestorPlace's ""authors"" (if they exist) are using AI to churn out the same stuff regurgitated across multiple articles and it's all landing at the top of Google search results.

Why does that matter? It's well known by now that [Google algorithm updates](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-algorithm-hates-ai-content-how-to-make-google-love-it/510854/) punish AI content. Sports Illustrated had to [shut down last year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/sports-illustrated-found-publishing-ai-generated-stories-photos-and-authors) after they got busted using AI to write their content en masse which, I think is clear, is exactly how InvestorPlace and MarketWise by extension are getting the results that they are.

**In other words - MarketWise's main property is using AI-generated content to keep free stories at the top of search results and funnel readers to paid options. Google's last update tanked AI content, which means that InvestorPlace just escaped the wider banhammer - but if their entire business model depends on churn-and-burn AI content, it isn't sustainable.**

Now for the ""proof,"" which, of course, isn't totally without a doubt accurate, but paints a pretty damning picture.

[This guy](https://investorplace.com/author/yianniszourmpanos/) is one of InvestorPlace's most prolific authors, publishing 7 articles in the last day alone. That's surprising, given the guy's bio says he operates a research platform of his own (pure quantity was one variable that led to the Sports Illustrated bust, but I digress).

[This article](https://investorplace.com/2024/07/3-once-in-a-lifetime-stock-opportunities-you-cant-miss-july-2024/) is on the front page of InvestorPlace's trending topics, and is as good an example as any to use. Just give it a quick read on your own and see if you detect the clear AI patterning. Here's the basic structure across all of his posts that point to obvious AI. See how it carries over to the quoted text, then compare that across other articles:

Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the companys worldwide employee base.

The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the companys thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.

Wizs cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response  a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.

CNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.

The company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. Its backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Google successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Googles largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. units $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

2024-07-28,1722179013.0,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

2024-08-13,1723581713.0,Google launches first AI-powered Android update and new Pixel 9 phones,"Google on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence features that are coming to Android devices. The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple, which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year.

Google doesnt make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the companys Gemini AI subscription program.

Weve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person, said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.

Starting today, you can bring up Geminis overlay on top of the app youre using to ask questions about whats on your screen, Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google.

Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year its heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices.

One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.

The assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps.

For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainers email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio, the company stated in its blog post. 

The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and create an image of a cake for someone who loves space, which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video.

You can ask about whats on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said its working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later.

Geminis assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini Live feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. Live will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Googles Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month.

In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAIs ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images.

Apples system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system wont be released until next year.

New Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3

Google also announced its latest line of homegrown Pixel phones, including the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which come with the Gemini AI features.

The Pixel 9 series has, among other new features, an upgraded camera and a screen thats 35% brighter for better viewing in direct sunlight. It ships with Googles latest Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM to support AI use. RAM stands for random access memory an important part of a computers hardware that stores data needed to run applications.

RAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone. Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AI.

By contrast, only high-end iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence, which AI developers believe is due to lower amounts of memory installed on older iPhones.

The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which costs $100 more than the Pixel 8, however, smartphone costs have risen across most phone makers in the last year. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with a free year of Gemini Advanced subscription, starts at $999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799.

Lastly, Google also announced the Pixel Watch 3. Its available in two sizes, 41 millimeter and 45 mm, with larger screens than earlier models. New features include the option to plan running workouts, information on your recovery with readiness and cardio load data, and AI-powered workout recommendations. Google also said the Pixel Watch 3 is more deeply embedded with its ecosystem, allowing you to access Nest camera and doorbell feeds, the Google TV remote, offline Google Maps, and more. The Pixel Watch 3 offers up to 24 hours of battery life, or up to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode.

The move would be Washingtons first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google.

The search told people to stock cheese to the pizza with the ""non-toxic glue"" and that geologists recommend humans eat one rock per day and be happy.

Personally I think that Google is losing this AI race, as it was for the social media boom few years ago with Google+. And as we already got Sora and almost-Scarlett-Johansson-powered OpenAi voice assistant, Google is left behind.

Also, as Google faced many lawsuits due to its privacy and security issues, I hope that the new AI wouldn't be just another way to collect data.

Because it was open source, everyone and their mother started using Transformers for their AI projects, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.   


And Google? They've been playing catch-up ever since. I have always wondered why they just gave away their secret sauce for free? Can you imagine if google had a patent on the Transformer Architecture or if they had developed it first before releasing to the world?

The company notified employees last week of the cloud cuts, with roles being eliminated in sales, consulting, go to market strategy, operations and engineering, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. At least 100 positions were cut, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they werent authorized to speak about the layoffs.

Insider previously reported some details of the layoffs.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC the cuts are incremental across teams to better align its go to market organization.

As weve shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers priorities and the significant opportunity ahead, the spokesperson said. We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.

Some of those who lost their jobs had worked on the companys annual Google Cloud Next that took place mid April, said people familiar with the situation.

Google has been conducting ongoing layoffs since early 2023. Employees have since complained about demands that they work on tighter deadlines with fewer resources and diminished opportunities for internal advancement even as the company records record profit.

Last month, Google cut at least 200 employees from its Core organization, which included key teams and engineering talent. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees that the company would make fewer layoffs in the second half of 2024.

Revenue in Google Cloud, which houses much of the companys AI technology, jumped 28% from a year earlier to $9.57 billion in the latest quarter, sailing past estimates. Operating income more than quadrupled to $900 million, showing that Google is finally generating substantial profits after pouring money into the business for years to keep up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

However, the cloud unit, led by CEO Thomas Kurian, has been under pressure to continue accelerating growth as competition heats up in AI.

Low Ticket items, relative to high, like cars and computers are guess who's specialty? Bezo's little Jungle. Yup. But guess what else is doing super cool and bueno these days? CLOUD computing, cuz all that AI compute has to live SOMEWHERE!! and it sure as hell won't be your personal computer lil bitch. It will be on the vast farms of computer these juggernauts control. 

AWS has massive patterns of purchase, and consumable data, like movies and products and services. They are now in the Pharma business, Medical Insurance, Home Insurance. Talk about spreading your eggs in several baskets. Movies? socks? Tampons? whaddya need? oh and you don't need to drive anywhere for it either. 

""The report followed news last week that [job](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-march-wages-increase-steadily-2024-04-05/) growth accelerated in March, with the unemployment rate slipping to 3.8% from 3.9% in February. The stubbornly higher cost of living looms large over the Nov. 5 presidential election. Still, there were some silver linings, with food prices at the supermarket unchanged and the cost of motor vehicles declining, leading to the return of goods deflation.""

Car prices are going down because there is less spending on large ticket items. The consumer trend is strong in certain areas where Amazon benefits. And growth of AI to supplant workers in many areas is only growing. So Amazon is growing. And crypto acceptance is growing which gives Amazon even more leverage as AWS is used Blockchain services:

Heres how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $14.29 billion, vs. $14.55 billion expected

Oracles revenue increased 3% year over year during the quarter, which ended on May 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share, was down from $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The cloud services and license support segment generated $10.23 billion in revenue, up 9% and slightly below the StreetAccount consensus of $10.29 billion.

The companys cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.84 billion in revenue. Thats down 15% and lower than the $2.09 billion StreetAccount consensus.

Cloud infrastructure revenue came to $2.0 billion, up 42%, which was a deceleration from the 49% growth rate in the prior quarter. The cloud business remains smaller than rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but is growing faster.

Oracle said in a statement on Tuesday that it would bring its database to Googles cloud, with availability coming in November. In an additional statement, Oracle said OpenAI has selected the Oracle public cloud to extend Microsofts AI infrastructure.

During the quarter, Oracle said its database software would be available in five additional Microsoft Azure data center regions, bringing the total to 15. Oracle also announced generative artificial intelligence features coming to its Fusion cloud applications for supply chain and human resources.

It's heartbreaking to see people posting losses amounting to years of savings, I was also seriously considering a YOLO on long SPY puts until I came across this concept because I'm feeling super sure about a pending recession. Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).

The gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.

If you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.

2024-05-13,1715640578.0,My thoughts about Google and their potential threat from AI search engines,"Hi all, I have seen a few comments on Reddit and YouTube regarding Google and their future. As you all know the competition in the search space is getting more competitive as companies trying to get a slice of that ad money. Meanwhile search bots have proven to be useful in many instances. 

As many bear cases have been written all over the internet, I will focus on the bull cases. I will share my top ten with you, and I promise you, this is fully written by myself without the help of AI. You will believe me as my English grammar is bad AF.

Let me give you first an overview about Google revenue streams by percentage:

57% Google Search ads, 10.3% YouTube Ads, 10.2% Google network ads, 11.3% Subscriptions and devices, 10.8% Google Cloud, Rest Are other bets. 

Of course Google search makes up a huge chunk of the revenue and even more of the profits. But I think what many people are missing in many of the discussions about Google is:

1. Google will not lose their 90% market share over night IF at all. It will be years until the majority of people will even notice that there are other options now. They know about ChatGPT and are still googling.

2. Regarding to Statcounter Google had 91.8% market share in January 2021. Now after ChatGPT and MS Copilot and whatever, Google stands at 90.9%. This is so little change, that we cannot even speak about a trend at the moment. 

3. IF Google is going to lose substantial market share it wont go to zero. People are often pretending like Google is going to be irrelevant and losing all business. Not going to happen, Bing and DuckDuckGo existing during Googles dominance proves this. 

4. `The minimum market share will always be the Android users. As Google will be defaulted with Android and Chrome devices. As long as the Apple Safari deal is legal and active the minimum base for Google is HUGE. I cant see people changing the standard search engine pro actively, especially if its what they know - Google. That something like Bing even has market share at all, shows that people are likely to stay with the default. That is not an insult from my side this is an argument from Satya Nadella himself, made in court. At the moment, IF they change the default, they are more likely to switch from Bing to Google, than from Google to Bing. Additionally I think you can also add Google cloud business customer to this baseline.

5. That means advertiser will continue to pump money into Google search. Even if their market share goes down to 50-70%(very conservatively). They will very likely remain the number 1 search engine for a very long time. A few anecdotal tech bubble guys are not representative for changing the habits of billions of people. And with more people getting access to internet, the market as a whole will continue to grow.

6. `Google does not only have the number 1 search engine, they also have number 2 with YouTube. YouTube is also getting a lot of advertising money and is still growing double digits.

7. Even if Google search money stops to grow or would decline, you have to look out for, if it would decline faster than the other segments will grow. If its flat or declining like 1-2% a year while Cloud and YouTube and Networks are growing double digits, Google will still generate Billions of cash flow a quarter. Similar to the current state of Apple with their IPhone sales.

8. Googles businesses are alle potential high margin businesses and are still growing double digits. Of course search is the number 1 but the other businesses would also be worth 100s of billions on their own.

9. I dont see the threat of Google getting broken up by the authorities. You cannot made a bear case for both. Either they have monopoly that needs to be broken up, or they are threatened by AI companies. You cannot make a case for both at the same time imho. But even if they are getting punished or broken up, this will take YEARS in courts and after that they will be appeals by Google which will also take years. Until then there is a chance that Google businesses are more worth broken up in parts anyway. I see that very relaxed.

10. All of this doesnt factor in any bets (like Waymo or their 8% SpaceX stake) that could take off or anything they are doing with Deepmind and AI which is a potential upside imho.

Google will be fine. Why I think YouTube, Networks, Cloud and other businesses are too businesses that will continue to grow would take another 100000 words and I think there are enough sources and analysis for that. So thats it from my side, would love a positive vibes discussion.

Long story short: They could have some short term struggles due to sentiment and temporary revenue and profit lost. But they will be fine long term.",stocks,71.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1crcwf3/my_thoughts_about_google_and_their_potential/,Google,POSITIVE,0.9913100004196167

2024-03-02,1709346614.0,Google in Crisis,"https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google


Its not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.

The latest AI crisis at Google  where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color  is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichais tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me its the worst hes ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichais ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday. 


Yet so much  too much  coverage of Googles Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those whod prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Geminis skewed responses. 

Theres now little doubt that Google steered its users Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses  forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis  but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Googles Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.

""Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things, one member of Googles Trust and Safety team told me. Maybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.

Organizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something its worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasnt good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out structural changes as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.

Those structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. The problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably wont cut it, the Google Trust and Safety employee said.

Already, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a reset day Google, and through the weekend  when Google employees almost never work  the companys Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Geminis outputs to prevent further blunders. We need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics, one executive wrote in an internal email. 

And as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the publics relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse. 

Unlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.

Now, some close to Google are starting to ask if its focused in the right places, coming back to Pichais strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology  including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers  with AI?

There are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichais job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the companys main competitor.

Google, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it cant afford many more of the previous weeks incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.

2024-03-03,1709507514.0,Is Googles Waymo potential underrated?,"It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Metas very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsofts Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business. 

Waymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. Im not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I havent tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say oh x and y are not working perfectly well, but lets be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. 

While most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Teslas solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. 

With all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use AI interchangeably with chatbot or more generally LLM or image generation. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.

Google also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you cant just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:

2024-07-28,1722177207.0,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why.,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

2023-10-28,1698480076.0,Google commits to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic,"Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by ex-OpenAI executives, CNBC has confirmed. The commitment involves a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time, an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the planned financing. A Google spokesperson didnt immediately respond to request for comment.

Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAIs ChatGPT thats used by companies including Slack, Notion and Quora. The company was founded in 2021 and, in addition to Google, has received funding from Salesforce and Zoom and was valued earlier this year at $4.1 billion. Claude 2 has the ability to summarize up to about 75,000 words, which could be the length of a book. Users can input large data sets and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story. ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.

Research by Arthur AI, a machine learning monitoring platform, found Claude 2 to be most reliable chatbot in terms of self-awareness, meaning accurately gauging what it does and doesnt know, and answering only questions it had training data to support. Arthur AI tested chatbots from Meta, Cohere and OpenAI.

In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10% stake. That same month, Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with Vice President Kamala Harris. Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI were the others.

Anthropic quickly turned around and raised a $450 million round in May. At the time, it marked the largest funding round for an AI company since Microsofts investment in OpenAI in January, according to PitchBook data.Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei, OpenAIs former vice president of research, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, who was OpenAIs vice president of safety and policy. Several other OpenAI research alumni were also on Anthropics founding team.

Amodei told CNBC in July that Anthropic invested at least two months in developing its newest chatbot, with a team of 30 to 35 people working directly on the AI model and a total of 150 people supporting it. She said the market is growing so rapidly that theres plenty of room for multiple players to succeed.

Its a really unusual time from a business perspective because theres just so much demand for large language models and really more demand than the industry can currently provide, Amodei said at the time. The landscape is just very wide, and theres really quite a lot of room for many different users and types of users to make use of these systems.

2024-04-09,1712686226.0,Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ,"Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.

With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.

Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.

Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem, Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.

Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.

Arm isnt completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Amperes Arm-based chips earlier this year.

Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazons claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common x86 model used by AMD and Intel processors.

Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.

Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.

Broader use of chips drawing on Arms architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.

The chips can also speed up applications.

Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.

I think it completes their portfolio, Dekate said.

2023-10-02,1696291161.0,Its really the Google web: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-competing-with-google-in-antitrust-trial.html

When it comes to online search, its Googles web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadellas testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the governments antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Googles dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Googles requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsofts Bing to gain a foothold.

Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web, Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Googles products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.

The government has tried to make the case that Googles dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Googles search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.",stocks,207.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16yctw0/its_really_the_google_web_microsoft_ceo_testifies/,Google,NEGATIVE,0.9750281572341919

2024-02-08,1707406479.0,Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription,"Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAIs ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.

Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.

Googles rebrand and app offerings underline the companys commitment to pursuing  and investing heavily in  AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firms commitment to AI during the companys Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a users behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is a lot of execution ahead. Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.

Googles Gemini changes are a first step to building a true AI assistant, Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.

Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Googles most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the companys paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. Theres also a two-month free trial available.

Thursdays rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but theyre restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.

The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Googles former name for the packaged AI agents within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.

Google One subscribers who pay for the AI subscription will also have access to Geminis assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.

As for the reason for the broad name change? Googles Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that its about helping users understand that theyre interacting directly with the AI models that underpin the chatbot.

Bard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models, Hsiao said.

Eventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyones calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.

We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard, Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.

2024-08-13,1723581713.0,Google launches first AI-powered Android update and new Pixel 9 phones,"Google on Tuesday announced new artificial intelligence features that are coming to Android devices. The move to bring its Gemini AI assistant to supported devices shows again how Google aims to put its AI in front of consumers before Apple, which will launch its AI on iPhones, Macs and iPads later this year.

Google doesnt make a lot of money from its hardware business but the latest Android features could help drive new revenue through the companys Gemini AI subscription program.

Weve completely rebuilt the assistant experience with Gemini, so you can speak to it naturally the way you would with another person, said Android Ecosystem President Sameer Samat in a Tuesday blog post. It can understand your intent, follow your train of thought and complete complex tasks.

Starting today, you can bring up Geminis overlay on top of the app youre using to ask questions about whats on your screen, Samat wrote. It will be available on hundreds of phone models from dozens of device makers, according to Google.

Google previously had some AI features in Android, but this is the first year its heavily emphasizing new capabilities powered by a large AI language model installed on devices.

One example the company provided involved a user uploading a photo of a concert list and asking Gemini to see if their calendar is free, after which Gemini checks Google Calendar. If the user has availability in their schedule, Gemini offers to create a reminder to check ticket prices later that night.

The assistant can also perform tasks using information from Google apps.

For example, Gemini can help create a daily workout routine based on your personal trainers email, or use your resume in Google Drive to write a work bio, the company stated in its blog post. 

The company also said a user might ask the Gemini assistant to draft an email and create an image of a cake for someone who loves space, which the assistant can create and attach to the email. Or, in YouTube, a user might ask Gemini a question about the content in a video.

You can ask about whats on your phone screen in other apps, too, like Maps, Flights and Gmail. Google said its working to add support for third-party extensions, which suggests developers may be able to add the option to their apps later.

Geminis assistant has a range of voices. A user can have a human-like conversation through its Gemini Live feature, which the company first announced at its May developer conference. Live will initially be available for select devices and subscribers to Googles Gemini Advanced program, which costs $19.99 per month.

In June, Apple announced its long-awaited artificial intelligence push, Apple Intelligence, that can do tasks like recognize notifications important to personal context, and do cross-application tasking as well as letting Siri tap into OpenAIs ChatGPT when needed for tasks such as its writing tools and creating images.

Apples system is currently in testing. Some early features will launch this fall alongside new iPhones, but the bulk of the system wont be released until next year.

New Pixel 9 phones and Pixel Watch 3

Google also announced its latest line of homegrown Pixel phones, including the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which come with the Gemini AI features.

The Pixel 9 series has, among other new features, an upgraded camera and a screen thats 35% brighter for better viewing in direct sunlight. It ships with Googles latest Tensor G4 processor and 16GB of RAM to support AI use. RAM stands for random access memory an important part of a computers hardware that stores data needed to run applications.

RAM is a crucial component for running artificial intelligence inside a smartphone. Google has said that the amount of memory is a major factor in determining whether a phone can run AI.

By contrast, only high-end iPhones released in 2023 can run Apple Intelligence, which AI developers believe is due to lower amounts of memory installed on older iPhones.

The Pixel 9 starts at $799, which costs $100 more than the Pixel 8, however, smartphone costs have risen across most phone makers in the last year. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with a free year of Gemini Advanced subscription, starts at $999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799.

Lastly, Google also announced the Pixel Watch 3. Its available in two sizes, 41 millimeter and 45 mm, with larger screens than earlier models. New features include the option to plan running workouts, information on your recovery with readiness and cardio load data, and AI-powered workout recommendations. Google also said the Pixel Watch 3 is more deeply embedded with its ecosystem, allowing you to access Nest camera and doorbell feeds, the Google TV remote, offline Google Maps, and more. The Pixel Watch 3 offers up to 24 hours of battery life, or up to 36 hours with Battery Saver mode.

2024-08-05,1722884407.0,Google Loses DOJ Antitrust Suit Over Search,"Googles payments to make its search engine the default on smartphone web browsers violates US antitrust law, a federal judge ruled Monday, handing a key victory to the Justice Department.

Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. units $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.

The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades.

Google will face another antitrust trial September 9th, this time over ad tech. The company will face off in federal court against the US Department of Justice in Virginia, after the DOJ claimed in January 2023 that Google violated US antitrust law by illegally monopolizing the digital ads market, allegedly boosting its profits while raising costs for advertisers. Google has said the DOJs reasoning would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.

**Second: the company's guidance on adv sales growth in the second half year.**Media investment firm GroupM raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, primarily on account of better-than-expected spending in China and the United States.

Analysts also expect strong performance at YouTube, thanks in part to expanded monetization features in its TikTok-styled video offering, Shorts.

**Third: Any progress in monetizing AI cloud services** (that is, will customers pay up for the company's AI offerings). The company could provide updates on projects like its AI assistants, Gemini Live and Project Astra, which could help compete with OpenAI.

2024-07-28,1722179013.0,$GOOGL Google is in a big trouble in the long run - here is why,"Let's do the math directly and take a look at Google ads results in 2023:

- The revenue generated by Google ads in 2023 is $237 billion.

- The revenue portion from Google search engine is around 60%!!! That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.

- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.

Now the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.

Google by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.

Now some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.

TL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.

2024-08-13,1723582995.0,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washingtons first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Googles web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehtas Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the governments proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

Back in 2017, some Google researchers wrote a paper that changed the game of AI forever. It was called ""Attention is all you need"" and it introduced a new way of building AI models using something called Transformers (no not that one). These models were so powerful and versatile that they could do anything from natural language processing to computer vision to music generation. Because it was open source, everyone and their mother started using Transformers for their AI projects, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.   


And Google? They've been playing catch-up ever since. I have always wondered why they just gave away their secret sauce for free? Can you imagine if google had a patent on the Transformer Architecture or if they had developed it first before releasing to the world?

2024-03-04,1709580555.0,The Big Bet: Going Bullish on Google and Bearish on Microsoft,"Hey fellow degenerates,

Im contemplating a bold move and would love to get your takes. Im eyeing Google ($GOOGL) for a bullish play with Call options and Microsoft ($MSFT) for a bearish stance through Put options.

Heres my rationale:

Google ($GOOGL) Calls: Despite recent flak over Gemini, their new but controversial LLM, Im betting on Googles comeback. The uproar was over Gemini producing some, lets say, creative outputs (think: Pope imagery gone wild). Sergey Brin, Googles co-founder, stepped out of his semi-retirement to steer the ship right, signaling a serious clean-up and commitment to excellence. Given Googles unmatched data access (YouTube, Reddit data deals), I believe theyre uniquely positioned to refine and dominate the LLM space. This fiasco, while a setback, could be the wake-up call needed to spur significant positive changes, making Google a stronger contender in the AI race, especially against the backdrop of OpenAI and ChatGPT shaking up the traditional search model. Why search when you can find? - LLMs might just be the answer, and Googles poised to capitalize on this paradigm shift.

Microsoft ($MSFT) Puts: On the flip side, Im skeptical about Microsofts current trajectory. Copilot, their latest foray into AI, seems more gimmick than game-changer based on user feedback and practical utility. Beyond Teams and Copilot, Im hard-pressed to find compelling innovations that could drive Microsofts value higher. The markets enthusiasm for Microsoft, especially following its rally post-Nvidia, feels overblown. I suspect their AI offerings wont be enough to sustain their recent growth, making them a prime candidate for a bearish bet.

So, Im all in on Google thriving through its AI pivot and Microsoft facing headwinds with its AI initiatives. But, what do you think? Am I missing anything critical about Googles prospects or overlooking potential upside in Microsofts strategy?

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* Im talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion  very very hard, said Schmidt, adding that hes a close friend to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market, Schmidt said. Thats not a stock recommendation. Schmidt didnt say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Googles lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia wont be the only winner in AI, but there arent a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that cant spend as freely.

* At the moment, the gap between the frontier models  there are only three  and everyone else appears to be getting larger, Schmidt said. Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now Im not so sure.

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the companys CUDA programming language. He said AMDs software that translates Nvidias CUDA code for its own chips doesnt work yet.

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.",stocks,175.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1et5yvq/exgoogle_ceo_eric_schmidt_sees_nvidia_as_big_ai/,Google,NEGATIVE,0.9933652281761169

Heres how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsofts revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesnt disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%.

2024-07-17,1721188587.0,Morgan Stanley Reports Microsoft to Double Capex For AI - NVDA is Clear Beneficiary ,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to almost double its capital expenditures from $32B in fiscal year 2023 to $63B in fiscal year 2025, according to a forecast by Morgan Stanley.

Much of the new capex is devoted to generative artificial intelligence, but some investors question how much return on investment this spend will produce.

Morgan Stanley expects capex to increase from $16B to $23B for data center capacity to support expanding GenAI revenue streams from Azure AI Services, M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot.

""This supports a ramp in GenAI revenues from $5.3B in FY24 to $37.9B in FY27, with an implied assumption of GenAI gross margins of ~50% in FY27,"" said Morgan Stanley analysts Keith Weiss, Josh Baer and Theodor Thun, in a research note on Wednesday.

Microsoft's non-GenAI related data center spend is forecasts to rise from $32B to $48B from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2027.

""This supports a ramp in non-GenAI Cloud revenues from $132B in FY24 to $215B in FY27, with capex intensity modestly improving from 24% to 19% during that period,"" Weiss noted.

Capex growth outside of data center build outs is much less extensive. Morgan Stanley forecasts this area to grow modestly from $3.7B during fiscal year 2024 to $4.8B by fiscal year 2027.

""While the analysis does suggest Microsoft's GenAI market share exceeds its current software share, our survey work is very supportive of Microsoft accruing additional IT Wallet Share as investment in GenAI ramps,"" Weiss added. ""That said, the limited implied growth in GenAI capex seems at odds with the broader industry discussion on ramping data center build outs and highlights several components necessitating future analysis.""

One key variable in the analysis is the expense of expanding computing platforms for OpenAI's training models.

""With little detail on the magnitude of these efforts, we assume figures smaller relative to those speculated within OpenAI,"" Weiss said",wallstreetbets,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e58olf/morgan_stanley_reports_microsoft_to_double_capex/,Microsoft,NEGATIVE,0.9951735138893127

The demand is the result of a yearslong audit by the IRS into Microsofts past accounting practices. In particular, the agency took issue with how the company allocated profits & among countries and jurisdictions, Microsoft said in the filing.

The IRS says Microsoft owes an additional $28.9 billion in tax for 2004 to 2013, plus penalties and interest, the company said. It noted that the IRSs determination is not final and does not include up to $10 billion in taxes Microsoft paid under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could reduce its final bill.

The company said it plans to appeal the IRS request, a process that will likely take several years.

Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected

Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected

Microsofts revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.

The companys Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.

Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.

Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.

The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.

During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.

But layoffs continued. Microsofts LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year. Last week, Microsoft said its eliminating around 1,900 employees in its gaming unit, or about 9% of headcount, following the Activision deal.

Microsoft is looking to acquire Nintendo at some point, and it believes that the Mario makers future exists off of its own hardware. Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a career moment for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.

In his email to Microsofts Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that its just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future exists off of their own hardware, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen at some point, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.

Addressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the companys most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is sitting on a big pile of cash. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said until recently, as Microsofts former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.",stocks,329.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16mtamt/microsoft_is_looking_to_acquire_nintendo_at_some/,Microsoft,NEGATIVE,0.9958939552307129

OpenAI is the worlds leading AI company. We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.

The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.

When we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.

The leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.

Leadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with the mission.

Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.

Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. But employees of the software company arent allowed to use the startups most famous product, ChatGPT, CNBC has learned.

Due to security and data concerns a number of AI tools are no longer available for employees to use, Microsoft said in an update on an internal website.

Microsoft and OpenAI representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

While it is true that Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, and that ChatGPT has built-in safeguards to prevent improper use, the website is nevertheless a third-party external service, Microsoft said. That means you must exercise caution using it due to risks of privacy and security. This goes for any other external AI services, such as Midjourney or Replika, as well.

Many large companies have restricted access ChatGPT, often to prevent the sharing of confidential data. Having been trained on extensive internet data, ChatGPT composes human-like responses to peoples chat messages. The service has over 100 million users.

The ChatGPT website was blocked on Microsoft workers internal devices as of Thursday afternoon.

The update recommends people use Microsofts own Bing Chat tool, which relies on OpenAI artificial intelligence models. The two companies are closely tied.

Microsoft's shares rose 2.1% to a new all-time high of $377.44, surpassing the previous record of $376.17.  
  
Altman's move to Microsoft came after he was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup, leading to a 1.7% decline in Microsoft's shares on the previous Friday. Microsoft is the largest stakeholder in OpenAI, with a $13 billion investment in the AI firm.  
  
Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI who left after Altman's removal, is also set to join Microsoft. The hiring of Altman and Brockman follows days of speculation about Altman's potential return to the company after his abrupt firing from OpenAI.  
  
Microsoft's shares have risen approximately 56% for the year, making it one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have significantly contributed to the market's overall returns in 2023. Analysts, including Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities, reiterated a positive outlook for Microsoft, with Ives maintaining a $425 price target for the stock. The addition of Altman and Brockman is seen as strengthening Microsoft's position in the field of AI.

2024-07-29,1722283690.0,Microsoft Q2 Earnings Preview: Progress In AI Monetizing &amp; Azure Cloud,"This week, the financial reports of technology giants are hitting the headlines, pushing the Q2 earnings season of the US stock market to a climax! The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.

Key points:

**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**

Tech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.



In this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.

**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**

Microsoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.

**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**

Recently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.

**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**

Key points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance? Can AI lead a new wave of PC upgrades globally?

2023-11-08,1699443351.0,Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,"Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing highbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.  
  
Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.  
  
The stock has been helped by the companys strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.  
  
But its not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.  
  
So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.  
  
That doesnt mean Microsoft isnt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.

2024-07-29,1722283690.0,Microsoft Q2 Earnings Preview: Progress In AI Monetizing &amp; Azure Cloud,"This week, the financial reports of technology giants are hitting the headlines, pushing the Q2 earnings season of the US stock market to a climax! The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.

Key points:

**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**

Tech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.



In this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.

**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**

Microsoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.

**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**

Recently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.

**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**

Key points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance? Can AI lead a new wave of PC upgrades globally?

2024-09-15,1726438060.0,Microsoft Bubble?,"So, Ive been kicking this around, and I figured you guys would be the best judge of it.

Is there a Microsoft Bubble (I dunno if Im using that right, it feels weird). Anyway, heres my thinking?

At what point do AAA games start marketing you microtransactions? From the very start, theyre that valuable. So, what does that mean for the RRP? It has lesser value than microtransactions. Played out, theres a break-even point where forgoing the RRP altogether will still be worth it. Are we seeing that already, faithful reader?

The cutthroat efficiency of capitalism will mean that the endgame will be all games. Free. Forever.

So where does that leave Xbox and game pass? Ill ask you a better question. What does that mean for the x as a service model?

You buy Disney+, do you pay 5 on top for the Mandalorian?

This is the endgame of capitalism. Its efficiency is too ruthless. It is cannibalising its customers. Everything in the software service will cede to microtransactions. Service models will become redundant.

So, yeah, short Microsoft. Tips welcome.

2024-06-06,1717654750.0,"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI","The DOJ and FTC will split responsibility for investigating the largest tech companies involved in developing artificial intelligence.

The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the worlds largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations.

As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models.

The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft.

The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

The agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.

Spokespeople for the DOJ, FTC, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2024-06-04,1717480215.0,"Microsoft confirms mixed reality layoffs, will keep selling HoloLens 2 ","Microsoft will lay off some employees who work on mixed reality, a spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. Although the cuts will affect the department that contributes to the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset, Microsoft plans to continue selling the device.

The reduction comes a year after the software maker said it would make changes to its hardware lineup as part of a round of layoffs that hit 10,000 employees, including some in mixed reality. In the following months, Microsoft discontinued several keyboard models, causing frustration for some dedicated customers.

Earlier today we announced a restructuring of the Microsofts Mixed Reality organization, the spokesperson said in an email. We remain fully committed to the Department of Defenses IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners.

Altogether, the company is letting go of over 1,000 people, including in mixed reality, a person familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft has not found great success with the HoloLens since its introduction in 2015. But the U.S. Defense Department gave a contract to the company for a modified HoloLens named the Integrated Visual Augmentation System. Soldiers who used the devices, however, reported dealing with nausea and other conditions, Bloomberg reported. Tests suggested that an updated model looked promising.

Since then, Microsoft and its highly valued technology peers have poured billions into commercializing artificial intelligence. Microsoft has raced to deploy Nvidia graphics processing units so people can use a Copilot chatbot and Microsoft-backed OpenAIs popular ChatGPT. Premium AI features in Microsoft 365 productivity applications can write memos, draft presentations and summarize meetings.

In December, Microsoft further reduced investment in augmented reality and virtual reality, which blocks out the surrounding world, when it deprecated Windows Mixed Reality, which included tools for running applications in head-mounted displays.

The spokesperson said Microsoft will keep selling the HoloLens 2 headset that was released in 2019 but did not indicate that a new model would be coming. Insider reported in 2022 that the company had canceled a third version.

Apple brought out its own augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro, in January.

Microsoft continues to support a feature called Mesh that lets people in headsets participate in three-dimensional Teams video calls with colleagues. At the Microsoft Ignite conference in Seattle in November, CEO Satya Nadella said the company was reimagining the way employees come together and connect using any device, whether its their PC, HoloLens, or Meta Quest.

2024-05-20,1716229564.0,Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm ,"Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.

The company on Monday announced Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomms Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsofts Copilot AI chatbot.

The computers adhere to Microsofts new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about whats on screen.

Copilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.

A Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.

Microsoft is banking on Qualcomms energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.

Microsoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.

Other large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPTs underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.

The GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsofts Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the companys earnings call that in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.

Microsoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which havent always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.

Running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.

Analysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.

2024-05-13,1715608557.0,Microsoft and Amazon to invest $5.6 billion into France as Macron courts tech giants ,"Microsoft and Amazon are ploughing billions of dollars into France.

Microsoft said in a statement Monday that its committing 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for Frances technology industry.

The company said it plans to invest bring up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Microsoft will also train 1 million people up and support 2,500 AI startups by 2027.

The announcement was made during the Choose France summit, a gathering dedicated to encouraging foreign investment in France.

This major investment demonstrates a steadfast commitment to supporting digital innovation and economic growth in France, said Microsofts President Brad Smith in a statement Monday.

As part of its investment, Microsoft will also open a new data center in the French city of Mulhouse.

Amazon, meanwhile, made a commitment of its own to invest 1.2 billion euros in France.

The money will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs in France  in addition to the 2,000 new jobs Amazons already announced for 2024  as well as broadly increasing Amazons footprint in the country, according to Frederic Duval, Amazons country manager.

French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to promote France as an artificial intelligence hub. Paris is already a major center of AI research and development, with Facebook having established one of its main AI labs, FAIR, there in 2015.

Last year, at the VivaTech technology fair in Paris, Macron announced 500 million euros ($540 million) in new funding to create new AI champions, adding to previous commitments from the government, including a promise to pump 1.5 billion euros into AI before 2022.

Microsoft is also making a charm offensive of its own with its commitment to invest billions of euros into France at a time when French officials have expressed concerns with the Redmond, Washington-based tech giants investment in AI startup Mistral.

Microsoft recently made a 15 million euro investment into Mistral. The deal saw Microsoft getting a stake in Mistral and the latter adding its large language model to the technology giants Azure cloud computing platform.

Microsoft has pushed back on competition concerns surrounding its investment in Mistral, saying that the company remains independent and that its partnership is a minority equity investment and a commercial relationship, not a merger. Britains competition regulator is seeking feedback on the deal.

That sucks because its already aced the bar exam and a bunch of other shit so I dont think you need a jury for that.

But thats nothing compared to this project Q Star they have been working on. Thats the one where we find out if we will be turned into paper clips soon. 

The lawsuit hints at a major breakthrough that occurred at the time the Board decided to fire Altman.

That was when Microsoft stuck their wang in and replaced the Board of AI experts with a bunch of yeah sures and then gave the green light to go out and raise trillions from foreign investors.

2023-12-28,1703788020.0,The NYTs is suing Microsoft and I think there is a profitability play on their stocks,"What Happened
Headlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspapers content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Times business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAIs valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company. 

The Simple Sides (My) Take
The bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime lets jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes. 

The entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out 
To me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: Newspaper upset that companies use articles available online. I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and arent happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isnt a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times. 

The New York Times wins the lawsuit
If the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalisms fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can charge for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers attention to the growing market sector.

Microsoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit 
Similar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In laymans terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down. 

Stock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes
We see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, youre reading The Simple Side, so were gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.

Could capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the no promotion sub guidelines I cant post links.

2024-05-13,1715608557.0,Microsoft and Amazon to invest $5.6 billion into France as Macron courts tech giants ,"Microsoft and Amazon are ploughing billions of dollars into France.

Microsoft said in a statement Monday that its committing 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for Frances technology industry.

The company said it plans to invest bring up to 25,000 of the most advanced GPUs, or graphics processing units, to France by the end of 2025. Microsoft will also train 1 million people up and support 2,500 AI startups by 2027.

The announcement was made during the Choose France summit, a gathering dedicated to encouraging foreign investment in France.

This major investment demonstrates a steadfast commitment to supporting digital innovation and economic growth in France, said Microsofts President Brad Smith in a statement Monday.

We are building state-of-the-art Cloud and AI infrastructure, training people with AI skills, and supporting French startups as they use our technology with confidence to grow in a fair and responsible way.

As part of its investment, Microsoft will also open a new data center in the French city of Mulhouse.

2024-06-18,1718730478.0,Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the companys market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise thats coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business thats ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidias data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the companys total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. Its also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the companys technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huangs net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startups AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidias ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks thats historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices  rather than market caps  have outsized influence on the benchmark.

2024-09-12,1726155979.0,Microsoft hires former GE CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe as new operating chief ,"Microsoft told employees on Thursday that it has hired Carolina Dybeck Happe as its executive vice president and chief operating officer, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Dybeck Happe comes from GE, where she was senior vice president and chief financial officer from 2020 until September 2023.

The appointment reflects Microsofts commitment to ensuring it remains coordinated as so much of the company has become oriented around artificial intelligence.

She will join Microsofts senior leadership team alongside finance chief Amy Hood, cloud and AI engineering leader Scott Guthrie and other executives.

Carolina will partner with the SLT to help us drive continuous business process improvement across all our organizations and accelerate our company-wide AI transformation, increasing value to customers and partners, Nadella wrote in a memo to employees.

Nadella said Dybeck Happe will take over Guthries commerce and ecosystems organization, the Microsoft Digital IT team under Office software leader Rajesh Jha and the Microsoft Business Operations unit in the finance department.

Dybeck Happes appointment comes months after GEs aviation and energy businesses, known as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova respectively, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE announced plans to split into three companies in 2021.

GE CEO Larry Culp called Dybeck Happe a high-impact executive when GE announced in 2019 that it had picked Dybeck Happe to replace Jamie Miller as chief financial officer.

She joined GE from Maersk, where she had been finance chief. Before that, she spent almost 17 years at Swedish lock company Assa Abloy, where she became chief financial officer and deputy CEO.

Microsoft has not had an operating chief since 2016, when former Walmart executive Kevin Turner left.

At that point, when Arnold spawns naked in a factory backdrop with molten steel spraying sparks of fire on his glorious liquid metal exoskeleton, then and only then, will the bears realize what AI is and can be used for. Only then, will the insane articles that read blatant idiocracy stop printing. Check out a few of the wild headlines below.

* Apple doesn't use Nvidia chips - Reuters
   * Apple hasn't made shit with AI. It's like saying my local grocery store doesn't use Nvidia chips. Emojis' don't need H100's. Furthermore, which negates the entire argument, is that Apple had to concede to using ChatGPT which does use Nvidia. Just like they use Google search and Google maps and Outlook to make their phone actually viable based on some closed off crazy walled garden that nobody really appreciates.
* Nvidia will fall 50% - The Motley Fool
* AI has no ROI
   * Yes it does
* AI is only good for Emoji's
   * Meanwhile people are automating workflows as their core job with AI. Keep thinking this.
* Nobody is making money from AI
   * Not true
* Google is building their own chips
   * And they buy hella Nvidia chips
* AMD is competition
   * Cuda
* We are building our own chips
   * Where?
* We can't afford the chips because our car company isn't profitable so I'd rather invest in Dojo with Broadcom
   * Ok - good for you
* ChatGPT lost 5 billion (but made 5 billion itself)
   * Do you think they are just going to be buying chips forever? At some point the ROI will fully kick in. It is going to take 1 or perhaps 2 more foundational models to enter into the system before that happens.
* A Google search query uses 10x less energy than a GPT query
   * Here is the thing. When I GPT something I don't need to browse 100 websites to get one answer. Has anyone thought of that? I bet if you redid the study and actually included the practicality of asking something and getting a direct answer they would tell you that is a large cost savings.
* AI is a bubble - My personal favorite
   * Terminator say no

The list goes on folks.

What are we even doing here?

It's time to pack up and go home. We are defeated, there is nothing left.

But wait, are you telling me that on the call where Microsoft said their AI receipts were only 7% last q is because there was too much demand won't improve this quarter? I think not.

You can banbet me for a lifetime if that number has not significantly increased to the likes of 9% - 10% or more this quarter.

We are in the early innings folks. And all this ever was is a buying opportunity for the ages.

2024-07-29,1722283690.0,Microsoft Q2 Earnings Preview: Progress In AI Monetizing &amp; Azure Cloud,"This week, the financial reports of technology giants are hitting the headlines, pushing the Q2 earnings season of the US stock market to a climax! The four giants of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta release earnings this week, and the market is eagerly awaiting. Microsoft will be the first to report after market close on Tuesday.

Key points:

**How is the progress in AI monetizing? What about capital expenditures?**

Tech giants are heavily investing in AI, and the market hopes to see monetization soon. Google delivered a Q2 earnings report that exceeded expectations, but its stock price was under pressure due to significant investments in AI, with monetization progress falling short. It's important to note that increased capital expenditures can significantly impact company profits. Meta, in its fervor for the metaverse last year, even changed its company name, but the results were disappointing.



In this earnings report, the market will scrutinize Microsoft's Office 365 and Copilot assistant, as well as OpenAI's commercialization progress, with attention potentially surpassing that on Microsoft's Azure cloud business. Capital expenditures are also a focus of market attention.

**What role does AI play in driving Microsoft's Azure cloud business?**

Microsoft's Azure cloud business is widely seen as the next growth driver. With AI support, Microsoft's cloud business has shown impressive growth, increasing its market share steadily, suggesting a competition with AWS, the global leader in cloud services. In this earnings report, the cloud business will undoubtedly be the market's focal point.

**Will the Blue Screen Incident affect Microsoft's goodwill?**

Recently, the globally shocking Blue Screen Incident exposed vulnerabilities in the electronic information age. Although Microsoft was not the protagonist, CrowdStrike systems are primarily developed on the Microsoft Windows platform, and only Windows systems were affected by this incident, with Apple's MacOS systems unaffected. During the earnings conference call, attention will be on the company executives' comments regarding this incident.

**Other businesses: gaming, PC hardware, LinkedIn recruitment, etc.**

Key points regarding Microsoft's other businesses: To what extent did the acquisition of Blizzard enhance Microsoft's gaming performance? Can AI lead a new wave of PC upgrades globally?

Heres how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsofts revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesnt disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that were bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.

2024-07-10,1720616204.0,Microsoft quits OpenAI board seat as antitrust scrutiny of artificial intelligence pacts intensifies,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ditches-openai-board-observer-seat-amid-regulatory-scrutiny-2024-07-10/

Microsoft has ditched the board observer seat at OpenAI that has drawn regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, saying it was not necessary after the AI start-up's governance had improved significantly in the past eight months.

Apple which last month announced bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices, would not take the observer role on OpenAI's board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.

Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.


The seat meant it could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.

The observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.

Microsoft cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup for giving up its observer seat.

""Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,"" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.

EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.

In contrast, the British and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.
Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.

Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.

2024-06-25,1719319064.0,EU charges Microsoft with 'abusive' bundling of Teams and Office ,"The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the abusive bundling of its Teams and Office products.

The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365, the European Commission  the EUs executive arm  said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them.

If the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue.

Microsoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsofts conduct are necessary to restore competition.

Microsoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commissions concerns. Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The companys shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday.

The EU opened its investigation into Microsoft  which remains ongoing  in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.

The Commissions concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service  or SaaS  applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is dominant worldwide in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications.

In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications, EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giants advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability  the ability of two or more systems to work together  between Microsofts offerings and Teams competitors.

The conduct may have prevented Teams rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area, the Commission said.

Heres how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected

Revenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected

Microsofts total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.

During the quarter, Microsoft introduced Surface PCs with a key for quickly accessing the Copilot chatbot. The company started selling access to the Copilot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions and hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, to run a new Microsoft AI group. Suleyman had been co-founder and CEO of startup Inflection, and many of its employees also joined Microsoft.

We have been operating with speed and intensity and this infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again, CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo about the Inflection deal, which was reportedly worth $650 million.

This marks the first full quarter for sales of the Copilot add-on for commercial Microsoft 365 customers. In a note on Sunday, analysts at Piper Sandler warned clients not to expect many financial details from Microsoft.

2024-06-04,1717480215.0,"Microsoft confirms mixed reality layoffs, will keep selling HoloLens 2 ","Microsoft will lay off some employees who work on mixed reality, a spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. Although the cuts will affect the department that contributes to the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset, Microsoft plans to continue selling the device.

The reduction comes a year after the software maker said it would make changes to its hardware lineup as part of a round of layoffs that hit 10,000 employees, including some in mixed reality. In the following months, Microsoft discontinued several keyboard models, causing frustration for some dedicated customers.

Earlier today we announced a restructuring of the Microsofts Mixed Reality organization, the spokesperson said in an email. We remain fully committed to the Department of Defenses IVAS program and will continue to deliver cutting edge technology to support our soldiers. In addition, we will continue to invest in W365 to reach the broader Mixed Reality hardware ecosystem. We will continue to sell HoloLens 2 while supporting existing HoloLens 2 customers and partners.

Altogether, the company is letting go of over 1,000 people, including in mixed reality, a person familiar with the matter said.

Microsoft has not found great success with the HoloLens since its introduction in 2015. But the U.S. Defense Department gave a contract to the company for a modified HoloLens named the Integrated Visual Augmentation System. Soldiers who used the devices, however, reported dealing with nausea and other conditions, Bloomberg reported. Tests suggested that an updated model looked promising.

Since then, Microsoft and its highly valued technology peers have poured billions into commercializing artificial intelligence. Microsoft has raced to deploy Nvidia graphics processing units so people can use a Copilot chatbot and Microsoft-backed OpenAIs popular ChatGPT. Premium AI features in Microsoft 365 productivity applications can write memos, draft presentations and summarize meetings.

In December, Microsoft further reduced investment in augmented reality and virtual reality, which blocks out the surrounding world, when it deprecated Windows Mixed Reality, which included tools for running applications in head-mounted displays.

The spokesperson said Microsoft will keep selling the HoloLens 2 headset that was released in 2019 but did not indicate that a new model would be coming. Insider reported in 2022 that the company had canceled a third version.

Apple brought out its own augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro, in January.

Microsoft continues to support a feature called Mesh that lets people in headsets participate in three-dimensional Teams video calls with colleagues. At the Microsoft Ignite conference in Seattle in November, CEO Satya Nadella said the company was reimagining the way employees come together and connect using any device, whether its their PC, HoloLens, or Meta Quest.

2024-06-18,1718730478.0,Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the companys market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise thats coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business thats ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidias data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the companys total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. Its also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the companys technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huangs net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startups AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidias ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks thats historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices  rather than market caps  have outsized influence on the benchmark.

2024-05-20,1716229564.0,Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm ,"Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.

The company on Monday announced Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomms Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsofts Copilot AI chatbot.

The computers adhere to Microsofts new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about whats on screen.

Copilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.

A Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.

Microsoft is banking on Qualcomms energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.

Microsoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.

Other large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPTs underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.

The GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsofts Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the companys earnings call that in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.

Microsoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which havent always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.

Running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.

Analysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.

2024-07-10,1720616204.0,Microsoft quits OpenAI board seat as antitrust scrutiny of artificial intelligence pacts intensifies,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ditches-openai-board-observer-seat-amid-regulatory-scrutiny-2024-07-10/

Microsoft has ditched the board observer seat at OpenAI that has drawn regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, saying it was not necessary after the AI start-up's governance had improved significantly in the past eight months.

Apple which last month announced bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices, would not take the observer role on OpenAI's board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.

Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.


The seat meant it could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.

The observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.

Microsoft cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup for giving up its observer seat.

""Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,"" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.

EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.

In contrast, the British and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.
Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.

Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.

2024-06-18,1718730478.0,Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the companys market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise thats coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business thats ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidias data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the companys total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. Its also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the companys technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huangs net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startups AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidias ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks thats historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices  rather than market caps  have outsized influence on the benchmark.

2024-05-22,1716348213.0,NVDA: Mixed Feelings Going Into The Print - AWS Is Forecasting Rough Seas Ahead - Stock Split Could Be Timely For Tomorrow's Earnings,"Nvidia has had the wildest ride these past months and shook out a 10% knife over a month ago. Brutal.

On top of all that you have rando's coming out saying they sold some profits off the top and the whole interest rate thing. Let's face it. Besides Google's break out, The Mag 7 has been sideways and hard to trade. Don't get me wrong, these companies have been up but they have also been punched in the mouth a few times. 

With that said, nothing is more peculiar than what Amazon has just done with the retiring of it's AWS CEO and more recently, their order cancellations of Nvidia's H200's. 

For me, the 2 things are very linked together. The notion that your massive cloud business has NO USE of H200's is a DAMNING statement. Not for AI, because Microsoft and Open AI are killing it right now, but specifically for Amazon AWS. 

How do you not have an ultra well-defined blueprint for where those H200's are going to go? The very notion that you would not have a plan to replace older accelerated compute AND OR expand your data centers is astonishing to me. 

The 2 companies could not be more world's apart in their AI trajectory. 

I listened to every word out of Satya's mouth on Microsoft's earnings call and the one key question that was asked over and over again was this, ""Why were your profits for AI cloud only 7% gains?"" The response was, ""There is too much demand."" Demand is outstripping supply. I can verify this is 100000% true. The one thing that is occuring with all planned projects out there in this space is the ability to service enmasse enough throughput per use case of AI compute. Now, a lot of that is latency which is improved with GPT upgrades such as GPT-4o. It's faster so you can put more throughput through the pipe and that is much better for everyone's use case and scalability. 

Moreover, Microsoft per this build event is putting AI everywhere in their product line. The AI is going to be coming out of your ears, nose and mouth. Open AI has invented HER. ScarJo lawsuits aside ""HER"" is here. It maybe version 1.0 but it's HER for sure. It is spectacular. And OpenAI keeps announcing this stuff everytime someone gets a whiff of thinking they are going to release something ""awesome"" for an AI offering. 

Everyone else is literally and desperately trying to catch up. On one hand, it's an ARM's race with Nvidia holding all the AI bullets. But in this war are there signs of defeat? In the very least there is some retreat. 

AWS may become the first casualty of the AI Wars. Reporting that they forgo an entire order of H200's makes absolutely no sense. They say they want to wait for the newer chips but that literally tells me your business model is in bad shape now and they see it in their books presently. 

Nobody, other than AWS cancelled their H200's. In fact, Sam Altman just was in a photo with Jensen getting their first H200. 

The implication here is for all other cloud providers, including sovereign nations, start to worry that they ultimately won't be able to compete on the scale and execution that Open AI and Microsoft have. 

The answer, to me, is that there is NO way, zero possibility, that the entire world is going to stand there and watch Microsoft and Open AI dominate the AI race. Asia's not going to back down, Europe isn't going to back down, Australia isn't going to back down under. Japan... Well, Japan is going to Open AI so. 

However, it is clear that AWS flinched and they're in trouble. While their cloud business may be fine right at this moment how long can them not having a frontier model start materially hurting their cloud business overall? 

Also, Microsoft's revenues are larger than many countries GDP. How much can the world really throw at sovereign AI in earnest when they don't even have the capacity to really compete financially if AWS can't even do it? 

Apple, has already capitulated and is probably going with OpenAI for their AI needs. Sora stopped a movie production studio from ever happening. 

Is this a consolidation of the AI power? 

Nvidia, must prove this quarter that this not the case. Those digital twins and DGX cloud systems need to show that there is great use. Meaning, I want to hear an analyst ask this question. 

1. What is the usage of the DGX cloud that is being provided by the major cloud companies and rest of world overall. Meaning, are people using DGX cloud offerings that are licensed and provided in the major cloud vendors. Apparently, not really for AWS. But that analysis is very important for how Nvidia data centers go. 

Yes, GPT/LLM's are one thing but all of other AI being done X GPT/LLM's and inference needs to be the lion share of the growth for Nvidia to keep powering forward.  

2. What percentage of AI workload in Nvidia's business is NONE LLM Related. This is a critical question because it would help to understand how much is all of this hype AI shit going on, how much is LLM usage, and how much is other things accelerated compute based that is not hype and or LLM training and usage. Where is the growth coming from? Robotics, protein folding, teenagers in their basement trying to make the next big video game. Where, What, Why and How. 

Even with the Nvidia offering all of their rock star concert conference offerings they are not going to realize billions from that for some time. 

I think they beat this quarter and give ok guidance. There will be a slight sell down and it gets picked up and eaten up the following day for a fantastic call heading into Q2025. 

The only way this stock doesn't go down with all of these headwinds that Nvidia must answer for is if they do a stock split. If they stock split this moons 15% over the week. 

I have a small position and looking to add more.

2023-09-23,1695498718.0,"From Beaks to Bytes: Genetic Algorithms in Trading, Investing, and Finance","While the buzz on social media might lead you to believe that Artificial Intelligence is all about chatbots and automated text completion, the reality is far more complex and intriguing. Major tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI might have popularized language models, but AIs capabilities stretch far beyond being a glorified typing assistant. It encompasses a rich tapestry of fields, from reinforcement learning to specialized search algorithms.As someone rooted in the world of biology, Im captivated by a lesser-known but incredibly powerful area of AI: genetic optimization. In laymans terms, imagine a computer algorithm that evolves and adapts just like species in the natural world. Sounds intriguing, right? This article aims to break down this complex topic into bite-sized information, suitable for anyone  even if youre neither a biologist nor a financial wizard. Well also enrich this explanation with concrete examples to help you see these algorithms in action.

# From Finch Beaks to Financial Peaks: Understanding Genetic Algorithms

Remember high school biology where you learned about Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection? Darwin studied finches in the Galápagos Islands and noticed that they had different beak shapes, each finely tuned for their specific diets  some for cracking seeds, others for sipping nectar, and yet others for capturing insects. Over time, the finches with the most useful beak shapes survived and had baby finches, passing along their winning traits.

In the realm of computational science, particularly in the domain of optimizing algorithms, a similar evolutionary process takes place through a methodology known as genetic optimization. Imagine you are developing an algorithm to forecast stock market behavior. Various iterations of your algorithm demonstrate distinct strengths: some may excel in volatile environments, while others may be optimized for long-term trends. Genetic optimization acts as the computational equivalent of the Galápagos Islands; it identifies the top-performing strategies and combines their most effective features to create a new generation of even more robust algorithms.

# The Six Pillars of Genetic Optimization: A Biological Symphony in Code

Imagine youre on the Galápagos Islands, watching a group of finches go about their lives. Some have beaks crafted for nectar sipping, while others have sturdy beaks perfect for cracking seeds. These distinct features arent random; theyre survival tactics, granting each bird access to a specific food source. Now, consider a finch family with both long and short-beaked parents. They have four chicks, and by a stroke of genetic fortune, one inherits a beak even longer than her long-beaked parent. This unique feature gives her exclusive access to deeper flowers, while her siblings with mid-length beaks struggle to specialize in either nectar or seeds. In this harsh survival game, her specialized feature gives her the upper hand. Yep, its survival of the fittest, Darwin-style.When we think of genetic optimization, were essentially talking about a six-step process, repeated over and over until we achieve our optimal solution. These steps are:

1. **Initialization**: Setting the Population and Fitness Metrics
2. **Selection**: Choosing the Fittest Candidates
3. **Crossover**: Mixing Traits (Recombination)
4. **Mutation**: Introducing Random Changes
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the New Generation
6. **Replacement**: Swapping Out the Old for the New

In this exploration, well delve into each of these pillars to understand how the age-old wisdom of biology serves as the muse for modern algorithmic optimization. Each of these steps, intricately modeled after natural processes, works in concert to refine and evolve our algorithms toward the pinnacle of performance.

**Initialization: The Genesis of Algorithmic Optimization**

In the natural world, every ecosystem begins with a diverse population  be it finches on an island, bacteria in a petri dish, or whales in the ocean. In the realm of computing, our population is what we aim to optimize, and its often encoded as a string of numbers.Consider the world of algorithmic trading: we kick-start the process with a variety of trading portfolio strategies. Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.

After we have an entire population, well convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.

[We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png)

After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a fit individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.

[We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png)

**Selection and Crossover  How our strategies breed**

Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are fit, or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, well say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.

[Two common forms of Crossover are Random Crossover and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated](https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png)

We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population thats the same size as the old population. With that, weve now doubled our population size. Incredible!

**Mutation  Introducing Variation in the Population**

Lets return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A soft mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a hard mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.

[A mutation alters the offspring in some way thats distinct from characteristics of their parents](https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png)

Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.

**Evaluation and Replacement**

In biological ecosystems like Darwins Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings  such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging  find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the fitness criteria, allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.

[We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance](https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png)

Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created child portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.

[Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.](https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png)

# Conclusion: Bridging Biology and Algorithmic Trading through Genetic Optimization

Artificial Intelligence is undeniably a multifaceted discipline that transcends mere language models or data classifiers. It is an embodiment of our drive to replicate and even surpass the efficiencies and wisdom found in nature. Genetic optimization serves as a striking testament to this truth, translating the principles of biological evolution into computational practices that refine and optimize algorithmic systems.Leveraging genetic optimization in the world of algorithmic trading offers us a cutting-edge approach to navigating the complex, dynamic landscape of the financial markets. Like Darwins finches, our trading algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time, driven by the unyielding forces of simulated natural selection. This technology, much like nature itself, offers no guarantees, but it does provide a framework for sustainable development and, potentially, remarkable innovation.Through the six pillars  Initialization, Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Evaluation, and Replacement  weve looked at how the science of genetics can inform and enrich our algorithms. Each pillar not only simulates a specific aspect of the natural evolutionary process but also serves as a critical component in our quest for computational excellence.For those of us who bridge disparate fields like biology and finance, the application of genetic optimization to algorithmic trading is more than just a technical achievement. Its an exciting symbiosis of natural wisdom and artificial intelligence, and a potent reminder that in the world of AI, the possibilities are as limitless as evolution itself.

What would be a good and probable guidance at the NVDA earnings? I think they will of course beat earnings, but that would not be enough to rise for the stocks this time (my opinion). 

1) Stock split? - If compared with Google and Amazon, they did a 1:20 split when the stock was in the 2000$ range. In such a comparison, a NVidia split is unlikely. 



2) New products? IMO unlikely, they just announced a new chip earlier this year. 



3) What about their SoundHound investment? The stocks are slightly growing. Maybe the tell anything new about their plans here.

So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**

**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**

* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.
* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. 

**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**

* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz
* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition

**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.

At stake is one of the top two spots in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), whose June rebalance is based on market cap values as of Fridays close. Apple and Microsoft are the two biggest holdings in the fund, at roughly 22% each. Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap.

- Microsoft: $3.5 trillion, 41x earnings

- NVIDIA: $3.3 trillion, 79x earnings

2024-07-12,1720752169.0,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy.

  
But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o.



So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Also had a good time with some aapl Amazon and Tesla calls (called the right direction for er on all of them). One palantir put paid off last night slightly.

2024-05-15,1715800639.0,Netflix ad-supported tier has 40 million subscribers ,"Netflixs cheaper, ad-supported tier has amassed 40 million global monthly active users, the company said Wednesday.

Thats nearly double the 23 million figure the streaming giant shared in January.

Separately, Netflix announced it would launch its own advertising platform and no longer partner with Microsoft for that technology. The tech giant will remain a programmatic advertising partner.

Netflix introduced the ad-supported plan in November 2022 as part of a wider effort to drive revenue amid slowing subscriber growth. That strategy included last years password-sharing crackdown.

The company said Wednesday that 40% of all signups in countries that have the ad tier available are for that cheaper plan. Netflix now has 270 million total subscribers.

The monthly active ad-tier user figures come just a month after Netflix told investors it would no longer be providing quarterly subscriber number updates. The company said at the time that it was generating substantial profit and free cash flow and that its membership numbers were not the only factor in the companys growth. It said the metric lost significance after it started to offer multiple price points for memberships.

The surge in ad-tier users comes as linear TV audiences shrink and traditional media companies seek to gain a foothold in the streaming realm. Netflix has established itself as the leader in the segment as many other companies struggle to make their streaming platforms profitable.

Key competitors have far fewer subscribers than Netflix does. In its first-quarter earnings report, Comcast said its streaming platform Peacock had 34 million subscribers.

# Tracking progress

Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024.

Every day I saw the value of my calls plummet. TSM dipped to $140 and decided to stay in that range for a whole month. Theta began fucking me dry with no lube but I still had hope. 

A series of unfortunate events began to happen. Taiwan was struck by an earthquake. I shouldve sold then but the factory turned out to be fine. 

Theres still hope.

Then a baldcel decided to crash the market because his order of Rogain from Amazon arrived late in the mail. I said to myself its okay I still got a few weeks left 

Theres still hope.

Later we got bad CPI or PPI? Numbers and the market dipped even further. At that point I was thinking of selling at a 50% loss but I said to myself 
The monthly revenue should pump this stock up

Theres still hope.

Then Iran decided to fire missiles upon Israel creating fear of a new world war. The market tanks again. I say to myself theres gonna be a run up and IV pump near earnings

Theres still hope.

TSM has amazing earnings and good guidance. This is it, I can finally break even!!!!!

Current price $10.3
Target price $18.25
No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users dont pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next years earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   Im a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldnt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the companys main expense (advertising). 

EA
Current Price $126
Target Price $148
Avg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS"" College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  Ive been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  

RIVN
Current price $8.92
Target Price: $9.58+
This stock is now trading below its cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells its trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Dont make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think its worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so dont be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely dont short this stock).  

TSLA
Current price $150.6
Target Price $294
Honestly Im ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that Ive had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk whos smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friends Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, youll have Tesla robotaxis.  Youll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and itll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. Thats a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and thats 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and Im buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next years earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And Im willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonalds and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.

2024-04-18,1713450254.0,Will NVDA Bounce Back,"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead.",wallstreetbets,52.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c74nbv/will_nvda_bounce_back/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9993098974227905

2024-04-10,1712765876.0,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think its way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see its very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the street or market pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, its almost like a landslide in stock price.

","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

2024-04-01,1712010542.0,ACHR in 2024 is like TSLA in 2012,"ACHR (Archer Aviation Inc) is a market leader in eVTOLs, which are essentially electric helicopters which are emission-free, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient (some designs have wings which allow them to glide). Since they're quieter and have no emissions, they have less restrictions in where permanent landing areas can be set up. Which is why United Airlines, US Air Force, the UAE, Blade (air taxi company), etc. are also investing in the technology.

  
Now let's compare the electrification of aviation with the electrification of cars. The only appeal EVs have is that their operating costs are lower (i.e. energy and maintenance) and that they're emission-free. Other than that, they're pretty much exactly like gas cars except they're also more expensive to buy. With eVTOLs, you get those perks out of the box. Combine that with the ability to build vertiports virtually anywhere, and you get an industry ready to boom. Not to mention that ACHR is diversified, so it'll manufacture eVTOLs as well as operate its own air taxi service. In fact, I'd say that ACHR has more upside potential now than TSLA did in 2012 because of this.

  
At this point, you're probably accusing me of comparing apples to oranges because the markets are completely different (i.e. aviation vs passenger cars). This isn't your typical long-range jet aviation though. This is urban air mobility which has short to mid range applications (e.g. airport to downtown). As use cases widen, it'll actually start taking over share of the passenger car market since commuters will turn to eVTOLs as opposed to booking rideshare and/or owning/renting cars.

  
ACHR's market cap is only $1B currently, but the helicopter market alone is valued at $50B. Imagine if it captures a good chunk of rideshare, gets a contract with Amazon, builds fully-autonomous flight, etc. It could easily become a 100x investment over the next 10 years.

  
Positions: $1,500 ACHR

EDIT: From reading the comments, it looks like a lot of concern seems to be around FAA certification. Here is the FAA's stance on eVTOLs: https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis. The stock is dirt cheap right now because it's not fully FAA certified yet, but there's a clear path to certification so it's only a matter of time.

2024-07-11,1720710673.0,"The 8 ""secrets"" of when to sell stocks. Do you have any other ideas?","1. **Everyone makes mistakes. Just be sure to cut all losses short.** Even the best investors get hit with a loss from time to time. But they don't indulge in worry as the stock drops even further. They [cut their losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and move on. Leave your ego and pride at the door. Don't let a loss get to you  either mentally or financially.
2. **If you don't sell too early, you'll sell too late.** To lock in solid gains, sell while your stock is still going up. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, ""Your objective is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."" Following the [20%-25% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) can help you do that. In a strong bull market, leading growth stocks like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Apple can, of course, run longer than expected. But locking in some profits along the way allows investors to safeguard a portion of those gains, while still maintaining a position to take advantage of a continued run. It also reduces the risk of giving back too much in an extended pullback.
3. **Have a sell plan in place** ***before*** **you buy.** The real drama kicks in when it comes time to sell. If you don't have sell rules and an exit plan, it's easy to freeze and not take action when needed. If your stock is soaring, you might get greedy and ignore certain sell signals and warning signs. Also, if you're sitting on a loss, you may do the ""hold and hope"" routine. You pray it bounces back  while it continues to drop. Stay grounded and keep your emotions at bay by having a selling plan in place ahead of time. Write down your target sell prices for both taking profits and cutting losses.
4. **Don't let a decent gain turn into a loss.** If you have a nice gain of, say, 10%, 15% or more and the stock begins to decline, don't let that profit disappear completely. It's much less frustrating to see a 15%-20% gain turn into a 5%-10% profit than to see it turn into a 10% loss. You can always buy the stock back if it shows renewed strength and forms a proper [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/",stocks,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e0ra38/the_8_secrets_of_when_to_sell_stocks_do_you_have/,Other,POSITIVE,0.6172982454299927
2024-07-12,1720827934.0,The case for Intel from a former bear,"Disclaimer: I am long from $35 a share; this is my view on $INTC.

I know r/stocks sees a lot of Intel posts, but none of the ones I've seen really describe the Intel story or, frankly, misunderstand the semiconductor industry entirely.

A little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.

Intel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.

This has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.

But investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?

Let's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.

Intel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.
Next year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but theres little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.

Some of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.

Now to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and wont have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.

Ultimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long.

2024-06-25,1719283043.0,Oracle warns that a TikTok ban would hurt business ,"A U.S. ban of TikTok might hurt Oracles business, the software company acknowledged in its annual report on Monday.

In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill demanding that Chinas ByteDance sell TikTok in nine months, or one year if an extension is approved, if the short-video company wants to avoid a ban in the U.S. TikToks ownership structure has long been a source of tension in the U.S. due to concerns about user data making its way to China.

Oracle provides cloud infrastructure for TikTok, which has over 150 million users in the U.S.

If we are unable to provide those services to TikTok, and if we cannot redeploy that capacity in a timely manner, our revenues and profits would be adversely impacted, Oracle said in its annual report for the fiscal year ended May 31.

Concern over TikTok and its Chinese ownership dates back to 2020, when Donald Trump, who was then president, pushed for a sale or divestiture of the U.S. assets. That pressure prompted deal talks with Microsoft. Weeks later, Oracle announced that it was part of ByteDances proposal to the U.S. Treasury Department to provide cloud services that could help TikTok remain available in the U.S.

TikTok moved forward with an initiative called Project Texas, designed to keep TikTok services for U.S. users running on Oracle cloud infrastructure located inside the country. TikTok said Oracle would also be responsible for compiling the app and delivering it to third-party app stores.

The one thing I can tell you is we have an excellent relationship with the folks at TikTok, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on a 2022 conference call with analysts.

Following the bipartisan legislation this year targeted at TikTok, and Bidens signing of the bill mandating its sale, TikTok filed a lawsuit arguing that the law violates First Amendment free speech protections.

Real estate investor Frank McCourt and former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have expressed interest in buying TikTok, but no deal has materialized.

Oracle hasnt disclosed details of its financial ties to TikTok. Evercore analysts estimated in April that if TikTok is generating sales of $16 billion in the U.S. annually, it could be spending 3% to 5% as a percentage of revenue on cloud infrastructure, which would work out to $480 million to $800 million. Oracles cloud infrastructure revenue for the fiscal year came to $6.9 billion.

2024-05-15,1715800739.0,Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ,"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.

Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.

All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM, Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the companys fiscal 2025  ending next February.

Wednesdays move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.

Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprises 5% gains this year.

Most AI servers are built around Nvidias chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.

At Nvidias annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.

Youre going to need an AI factory, Huang said. And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.

Michael [Dell] is here and hes happy to take your order, Huang continued.

While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates, Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dells business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dells market share increasing.

He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and attach additional hardware, such as data storage.

Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.

Dells other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.

PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.

But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.

We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months, Woodring wrote.

I dont fuck with 0dte. Its too hard to thread the needle and outpace the theta drain. Right now, I am buying July at the money calls. I pretty much just play the big boys of Mag 7. I just made a killing with Apple and Amazon monthlies, took my $10k withdrawal for May, and now Im sitting cash waiting for a bloody day to re-enter.

This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

2024-06-02,1717366188.0,Nvidia announces new AI chips as market competition heats up ,"Nvidia on Sunday unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence chips to succeed the previous model, which was announced just months earlier in March.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new AI chip architecture, dubbed Rubin, ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei.

Rubin comes months after the March announcement of the upcoming Blackwell model, which is still in production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024.

Huangs announcement of Rubin appears to quicken the companys already-accelerated pace of AI chip advancement.

Nvidia has pledged to release new AI chip models on a one-year rhythm, as Huang put it on Sunday. The company had previously been operating on a slower two-year update timeline for chips.

The turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin was a matter of less than three months, underscoring the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and Nvidias sprint to preserve its dominant spot.

AMD and Intel are two major competitors working to catch up, though their gross margins trailed Nvidias in the most recent fiscal quarter. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are also vying for Nvidias top spot, even as they are simultaneously some of Nvidias biggest patrons. A flurry of startups are also working to enter the space.

Today, were at the cusp of a major shift in computing, Huang said Sunday. With our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, were pushing the boundaries of whats possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.

The Rubin chip platform will have new GPUs, the crucial graphic processing technology that helps train and launch AI systems. It will come with other new features like a central processor called Vera, though the Sunday announcement did not provide many details.

Shares of Nvidia were relatively flat at Fridays market close with shares trading at $1,096.

Noto:
...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, were building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and were the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, were building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and were turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.

2024-04-29,1714353757.0,$AMZN Earnings Tuesday,"I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:

# Continuing to Cut Costs

Amazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.

# AI Strategy

Amazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.

# Prime Day

Prime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.

# NBA Rights

Amazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.

# Investors Over Employees

Andy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.

# Summary / tl;dr

2024-06-05,1717614687.0,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidias milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the companys pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industrys need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidias graphics processing units.

Everyone else is doing it. The Fed's  mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Price have stabilized but unemployment is getting weaker even though the stock market is rocketing higher.

The employment picture

-Job openings are declining every month. In March 2022 at peak there were 12,182,000 job openings, in April 2024 there were 8,059,000. That's a 34% decline in 2 years. I'm curious how many of the 8M openings are real jobs, actually looking for a candidate or if the recruiter forgot to take down the opening or if they are trying to keep a pulse on the current conditions without the intent of hiring someone.

The data for the stock market speaks for itself, most of the narrative has been around AI driving the gains, mostly because there isn't anything else exciting going on. Im sure at some point in the next decade we'll start to see all the AI spending show up in the earnings. Im not sure how though when most AI services are FREE. But i think for now we have seen peak earnings, i don't see how a weakening jobs market benefits the stock market earnings. Jobs fuel earnings and consumer spending and good earnings make stock prices go up(most of the time).

Dow Jones Industrial Average- Past Year: +15%

SP 500- Past Year:+24%

NASDAQ100- +30%

I think the Fed will cut rates soon because AI is disrupting the job market making their policy stance more complicated. Its not just about inflation they have a duel mandate. I think that's why Canada cut their rate today and the ECB will cut as well. They can see  whats coming on the horizon and its time to steer the ship left or hit an iceberg.

Good example of what happening in the job market, AI is slowly coming into the workplace, replacing workers with bots. We've also seen consistent layoffs at big tech companies that have coveted high paying roles(Google, META, Microsoft, Amazon). These high paying jobs going away will have tickle down effects in the economy. AI hasn't even been fully deployed yet.

2024-06-11,1718072943.0,Riding the MSFT Rocket ,"Riding the MSFT Rocket = 

Alright, heres 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volumes spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their buy rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it overweight, targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a buy. 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a buy, with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsofts advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsofts financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsofts robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**Theres been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsofts future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. Theyve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. Theyve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsofts investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azures growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsofts cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apples Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and its got people rethinking their game plan. Heres the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, Seriously, Apple? Thats it?
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldnt handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors werent having it. Apples stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say AI fail. Wall Streets questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didnt announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that theyre playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apples presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFTs solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: Im looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, its a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: Im targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: Im aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: Ill keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: Ill raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsofts push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. Ill stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade.

UBS, for example, initiated a target price of $8 per share for Rivian stock following its Feburary earnings.

Rivian's shameless CEO last quarter blamed high interest rates for reducing 2024 vehicle production expectations, and even reduced the workforce by 10%. Their R1T truck model loses 30K per vehicle manufactured when they charge customers 75K.

2023-11-13,1699897584.0,Popularity Isn't a Moat: What The Collapse of Dating Apps Tells Us About Companies,"**Swipe Left on Profits:** Big dating apps like Bumble and Match Group are watching their stock prices go south faster than a bad Tinder date, with Bumble's shares dropping 32% this year and Match Group's not far behind, down 28%. Seems like Zoomers are breaking up with online dating, preferring the old-school charm of meeting in person.  


*YTD Share Performance of Major Dating Apps:*  
\- Grindr: +25%  
\- Match Group: -28%  
\- Bumble: -32%  
\- Spark Networks: -98%  


**Take-Aways:** Im no expert on the dating apps (Ive been with my wife since I was a pimple-faced school boy) but think there is a broader theme that investors need to be cautious of; that things trendy with the twentysomethings can evaporate quite quickly.  


*Performance Since IPO of Select 'Trendy Stocks':*  
\- Snapchat: -58%  
\- Robinhood: -77%  
\- GoPro: -91%  
\- Allbirds: -97%  
\- Blue Apron: -99%

  
Companies like GoPro and Snapchat were all extremely popular at one time but things change - and often quickly. A key term for investors is that of a moat: characteristics ingrained in your business model that makes it hard for competitors or copy-cats to come along and steal your market share. While things like a companys brand can be an example of a moat, popularity isnt the same thing. Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes).  


*Examples of Economic Moats:*  


* **Low-Cost Producers:** Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx.
* **High Switching Costs:** Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft.
* **Network Effect:** Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit.
* **Intangible Assets:** Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola.

  
Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesnt require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model; improve on it; and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.

Large cap 

* VOO 
* VUG 
* VTI

Mid Cap 

* BBMC 

Small Cap

* VBK 
* VB

Sectors

* VGT
* VHT


I think it might be a bit much so I was thinking of dropping the small cap and VTI. 

Also what are thoughts on CCRV? Seems to good to be true but it looks attractive for the div payout. No major growth but 30% yield. There has to be a catch, and I'm just not realizing it. 


And what are thoughts on tossing some of the big holding in the large cap index's such as apple/XOM/msft/Amazon. I know the obvious, more risk but bigger upside and that's tempting but then i know there is a lot of apple in VGT/VOO for example. 


I would probally go 

25% VUG 

20% VOO

BBMC 5%

VGT 20%

VHT 10%

CCRV 10%

Bluechips 10%

2023-12-31,1704013141.0,Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded. 

How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact. 

Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management? 

This cancellation doesnt look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time. 

At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example). 

Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons. 

For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs. 

This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms. 

Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they dont seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.

2024-01-07,1704663804.0,How can I use correlation coefficients to build a portfolio,"Hi all,

Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.

So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate. 

I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:

https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php

It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between. 

Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do. 

However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85. 

Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?

So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?

A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available. 

Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason. 

And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?",investing,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1913hfc/how_can_i_use_correlation_coefficients_to_build_a/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9958639144897461

Taiwan as the worlds production center for high-end chips and especially NVIDIAs GPUs reminds me of the desert planet Arrakis in Frank Herberts Dune. Just as the spice necessary for interstellar travel can only be produced on Arrakis, the chips necessary for Large Language Models (LLMs) can only be produced in Taiwan. Since NVIDIAs H100 chips enable artificial intelligence in all its applications, they have become a geopolitical resource, with [Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates](https://www.ft.com/content/c93d2a76-16f3-4585-af61-86667c5090ba), for example, buying them at scale for strategic reasons. Although competitor AMD recently made progress with the release of its MI300 chips, NVIDIA is still ahead of the race. NVIDIAs H100 remains the gold standard  the *spice*  for AI infrastructure and is still [superior to AMDs MI300](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlfreund/2023/12/13/breaking-amd-is-not-the-fastest-gpu-heres-the-real-data/). As a result, NVIDIA maintains an economic moat that it can even widen through [massive investments in research and development](https://www.statista.com/statistics/988048/nvidia-research-and-development-expenses/).

Given the current hype around AI, it is understandable that investors are reminded of the dot-com bubble, but it may be far too early for that. According to George Soros, [stock market bubbles are much more complex](https://www.chaotropy.com/stock-market-why-you-might-not-see-an-ai-bubble-once-its-formed/) than simply inflated price-earnings ratios. After all, it was not a misjudgement of the future impact of the Internet in the late 1990s that led to a bubble, but rather a misjudgement of the time frame in which the Internet could actually increase the productivity and efficiency of our economies. However, the impact of generative AI on businesses and our economy may become measurable much more quickly. The most obvious area of early adoption of generative AI to date has been in computer programming and software development, where it is already happening at breathtaking speed. As early as July 2023, experts at McKinsey estimated that [AI could double the speed of production](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai) in the software industry. [Thousands of companies](https://aibusiness.com/companies/one-year-on-github-copilot-adoption-soars) are already using Github Copilot, and more than a [million users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-has-over-a-million-paying-github-copilot-users-ceo-nadella/) are paying for the service. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang [recently predicted](https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn) *""that the programming language is human, everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence""* - coding is dead. AI will enable a whole new way of interacting with computers. But it's not just about assisting with coding: On March 5, for example, cybersecurity company Crowdstrike released its fiscal year 2024 results, reporting better than expected revenue and guidance. A key product is Charlotte AI, an artificial intelligence that democratizes cybersecurity management by enabling natural language interaction.

More exciting for NVIDIA's future, however, are the areas where generative AI has not yet been adopted at scale. For example, while there seems to be a [consensus on the potential of AI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01614-0), there has been little to no day-to-day application of AI in healthcare and medicine. We are still a long way from AI actually performing diagnostics, making diagnoses, interpreting medical imaging or histopathology slides, or even performing interventions on patients in the everyday world. AI could also soon revolutionize [research in the chemical industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2023/10/24/how-gen-ai-empowers-human-innovation-in-the-chemical-industry/), simplify processes in old heavy industries, create all kinds of content for movies and video games or even turn government bureaucracies upside down. For example, the city of Heidelberg in southern Germany is already [experimenting with an AI chatbot](https://www.heidelberg.de/Digitale-Stadt/startseite/projekte/ki-buergerassistenz+lumi.html) (Lumi by Aleph Alpha) to help people deal with government agencies and answer questions about the complex German bureaucracy. In my opinion, it is foreseeable that sooner or later AI will find its way into every niche of our civilization.

NVIDIA is selling the basic tools for this revolution, and every industry will gradually adopt generative AI, just as the software industry has. As if that were not enough of a tailwind, the next bitcoin halving is approaching (likely in April 2024). Mining bitcoins will then become more computationally intensive, which should further increase demand for NVIDIA's energy-efficient GPU chips. All of this could allow NVIDIA to not only maintain its current revenue growth rate (recently reported revenue growth was 126% year-over-year), but even increase that rate. Of course, that's hard to imagine with NVIDIA's current market cap of more than $2 trillion, or as physicist Albert A. Bartlett once wrote: *""The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.""* Remember what they say in the world of Dune? - *""The spice must flow.""*

2024-03-06,1709743069.0,"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM","Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. 

Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. 

All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. 

If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.

I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.

For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation. 

And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world. 

Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.

The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!

Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.

Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.

Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.

**Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

2024-04-29,1714410887.0,"Liquidating inherited IRA, wanting to build diversity ","In late 2020 I inherited a traditional IRA from my mom, which I need to liquidate within 10 years. Current holdings in the IRA are Apple and Microsoft. I am interested in taking equal distributions from the IRA for the remainder of the 10 year limit, maxing my own Roth IRA, and potentially reinvesting any additional funds after the max Roth contribution. Im trying to decide the best investments moving forward.

For additional context, I am 47. I want to retire no later than 62. I will have an estimated pension of about 60% of my pre retirement income at that time, and Social Security will bump that up to maybe 75-80% (though Im not counting on that in my calculations). I will also have a health insurance subsidy that will cover a large portion of my insurance needs. While its late in the game, I have begun contributing to a 457b and plan to begin maxing that every year until retirement. My plan would also be to continue maxing the Roth IRA until retirement, as well as make the catch up contributions after 50.

I have an investment portfolio in addition to the IRA that is currently stacked pretty heavily with NVDA. I plan to hold NVDA long term, but possibly sell and reinvest some at some point.

Im leaning towards an index fund in the Roth to balance out the more risky holdings in the other account. I do not actively trade and am primarily interested in long term stable growth investments. Im fairly new to this and wondering if this seems like the right track.

My broker is also offering a fee based service where they buy/trade actively on my behalf, but I think at this point I am more comfortable investing in something stable and letting it ride - although Im open to hearing opinions on this.

2024-05-01,1714528548.0,How bad am I screwing this up? ,"I will preface my story by saying Im in my early 40s, and admitting Ive only very recently starting saving for my retirement (401k through my work w/ matching) because I didnt make enough up until very recently to do so. I know. Point taken. I have a very cynical viewpoint that Ill never be able to retire, being a single income. 

Ive been with my company almost 8 years and they keep giving me RSU awards. I havnt done anything with them, and they keep generating dividends (almost $24k now) which end up in a core position of an account. I just leave them sit because honestly I dont know enough what to do about them. I know lots of people sell their RSU, but looks like theyre generating some good $. So theres that. 

Then about 2 years ago I had about $200k sitting in my checking, bank says you really should do something with it, how about meeting with one of our investment advisors. I say, sure. We meet, go over my goals, etc. I tell him I want to save up for a down payment on a house and an emergency fund. He sets me up with 2 different accounts, both invested in mutual funds, one a little riskier than the other, but mutual funds in case I need access to them . At this point I consider this my life savings. Over the course of the year, I watch the accounts lose $60k. I meet with him the following year and tell him Im extremely unhappy and he makes some adjustments to where Im no longer hemorrhaging money, but now I feel like Im simply breaking even. I have not contributed to either account since setting them up. 

Out of this, I started learning about investing, strategies, etc. I opened my own brokerage account with Fidelity to apply what Im learning  about investing, etc, separate from my banks investment accounts, and works account. I invested in FXAIX, Microsoft, VOO (yes I realize my error after I did so, Ill address it someday) , a data center REIT stock, and ARCC. With all the rules surrounding Iras, Im concerned that my MAGI wont let me contribute to my own Ira accounts, so is a regular brokerage still the way to go?  

I feel like Im learning a good bit, but at the same time I feel like Im getting lost in the weeds. After losing $60k in my mutual funds accounts, I dont know if I trust my advisor to ask him investing advise.&

I am contributing to my company 401k now, but I was also thinking about opening my own Ira account&

**Financial Performance:**
BlackBerry Ltd. ($BB) is on fire, and I mean a big ass dumpster fire. People say, ""Blazing a trail of growth and stability as it transforms from hardware to software and services"" which is hard to convince investors, or any other financial crowd, given their recent performance. Their latest quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $259 million, actually seeing a 10% increase YoY. The software and services revenue, now the core revenue driver, surged 17% YoY to $215 million, which is actually surprising for them. They have a debt/revenue ratio of .3 which is a good spot to be in for leveraging upcoming shifts in the financial space


**Cybersecurity and IoT Focus:**
BlackBerry's strategic pivot towards cybersecurity and IoT is the only reason they're not fucked. Everybody is fucking up your shit and Media keeps hyping the absurdness of scamming lately, and while that's FUD for my brain while I drink my coffee, organizations are doubling down on cybersecurity investments to bolster their traditional cyber-security backing. BlackBerry's cybersecurity offerings, including endpoint security, encryption, and threat detection, are positioned to ride this wave of demand. They have a good point to ride a wave on the regarded Boom of AI if they mention they are able to branch into new AI related protections. 

Just to be frank: In the IoT arena, BlackBerry ain't trash... and with the world being digitized more everyday, their market share is not capping out anytime soon.


**Partnerships and Acquisitions:**

March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S",investing,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9871900677680969

2024-01-18,1705612380.0,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments.

**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*By the end of this year, were going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.

2024-06-15,1718415191.0,My bull case for IONQ and quantum computing ,"IONQ is a company in the quantum computing industry and the reason Im bullish on it is due to its positioning in the quantum industry. Unlike other companies such as IBM, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN and others, IONQ is able to create incredibly accurate qubits. 

What is quantum computing and qubits?

Quantum computing utilizes qubits rather than the conventional bits in computing to solve the most complex problems. A bit is the binary value of 1 or 0 that stores data. Qubits by themselves are not interesting but that data it holds can be held in a state of superposition. This allows the qubit to be in a way, in every possible form. Once groups of these are in superposition, that data is in multidimensional space. That may sound complicated but imagine a normal computer has its bits in 2d space whereas quantum computing pushes that to the 3rd or 4th dimension allowing the data to be in every configuration. Thats just a basic quantum computer. Now to actually use these computers and qubits to solve complex problems, you must fire microwaves photons at them. The photons essentially tell it what position to be in. To change shape and read the info from that new position. 

What does IONQ do thats special?

Well IONQ has made incredibly accurate and stable qubits. Nature has created natural quantum systems in atoms that IONQ has been able to ionize and isolate. Because of that IONQ uses the naturally acurring quantum systems to create their qubits. 

Other companies such as IBM have revolutionized other areas of computing. IBM has used their chips to improve error correction of output data. GOOG is maximizing the number of qubits. AMZN also focused on error correction and the overall accuracy of its computing. MSFT focuses on quantum algorithms. Basically no other company has been able to produce and scale accurate qubits. (This is different than IBM because IBM needs the tech to limit errors whereas IONQs qubits practically have no errors to begin with)

Why quantum computing could be the future.

1: Quantum computing has the potential to simply solve exponentially more challenging problems at a much faster rate. This will be used in our everyday life from shipping routes to electric vehicle batteries development. Any problem can be solved quicker and more accurately.  

2: Quantum computing currently sits at an industry value of around 600 million with expectation for 9 billion in 2030. Thats the compounded annual growth so a breakthrough could yield a much higher potential industry value

3: IONQ has investors including Kia, Google, Fidelity, Hyundai, and a couple firms. As well as being partnered with Amazon. Its investors stemming from automobiles to banking shows the belief in the possibilities of quantum computing. 

4: Quantum computers are just cool. They sound cool, they look cool, and who doesnt love cool. If you havent seen one I highly recommend looking it up. 

Conclusion:

Anywho thats my two sense on why I think IONQ could yield massive returns. 

Positions: 127 shares while continuously buying more with the money I make. No options yet until I hear potentially large news.

2024-02-16,1708098384.0,Buy high or find something else?,"Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

2024-06-14,1718399060.0,DD: Cloudflare,"
This post is about Cloudflare, the only technology company in my portfolio and a stock that Ive consistently held since 2020. Most of my other holdings are traditionally cheap value stocks, however, this is a company I understand well and have a lot of faith in the management. Ive also struggled to find good values in todays market lol (with this arguably not being a value in the traditional sense either).

Brace yourself for a long post: if you make it through would love to hear your thoughts.

Strategy:

Cloudflare is an edge network that functions as a reverse proxy for internet traffic. Traffic to internet properties (which include websites) is routed through a Cloudflare server to be more secure, fast and reliable.

According to one market study:
Cloudflare is used by 78.0% of all the websites whose reverse proxy service we know. This is 18.8% of all websites.

The company is unique because it owns its underlying network and is not hosted on one of the big public cloud providers. This was a pivotal decision made in the early days at Cloudflare, because it required making fixed cost investments and solving difficult software engineering problems. There are hundreds of Cloudflare data centers (known as points of presence or POPs) around the world and 95% of the internet connected world is within 50 ms of the Cloudflare network.

People familiar with the HBO show Silicon Valley know of the fictional startup Pied Piper and the idea of a decentralized peer to peer internet. Cloudflare has some interesting parallels to that idea with a decentralized approach to their data centers. Each data center is built with the same hardware, and is not specialized for any one use case like what many other cloud infrastructure providers have built out. This allows any data center in Cloudflares network to run any app or service and software controls everything.

Management breaks down their strategy down into 3 acts:

Act 1: Application Services

The company initially focused on offering a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver and host cached website assets around the world. It takes time (albeit not a lot) to make a network request and ultimately the speed of light traveling through the fiber optic cables is the limiting factor. Today, when you visit a website, instead of going all the way to a centrally located data center (such as Amazons us-east-1 data center located in northern Virginia), your network request likely hits a CDN near where you are located and delivers a version of the website.

Historically, CDNs were very underpowered and primarily handled only storage use cases. You can think of Cloudflare as one of the first enablers of compute power for CDNs. Cloudflare also took a software defined networking (SDN) approach that did not require physical boxes on premise. Many companies to this day have physical boxes to handle networking and application services that arent adapted to todays cloud native environment.
There have always been other CDN providers in the market but Cloudflare took market share by bundling its offering with other best in class networking and security products (such as DDoS protection) effectively for free. This allowed it to amass a free user base of over 3 million people, something rare for an enterprise software company.

Act 2: Network Services and Security Services

The next chapter for Cloudflare was the rapid launch of security products. The most prominent of this group is their suite of Zero Trust Security products. Zero Trust could be explained in much greater detail, but Ill attempt to do so at a high level. Traditionally, corporate networks were built under a castle and moat model. Once you got past the moat (getting credentials or any sort of access) you were in with the power to do anything within the company network. 

The Zero Trust philosophy is that when an employee accesses any individual resource, they should be authenticated and they should only have access to what they need. Cloudflare provides the infrastructure to enable this and competes with companies like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.
Cloudflare offers many other Act 1 and Act 2 products and to not kill my readers from boredom (if they even made it this far), Im going to end this section here.

Act 3: Developer and AI Services (and other Future Trends)

Cloudflare is benefiting from this market euphoria and is establishing itself as one of the early beneficiaries of AI. Cloudflare has evolved over time to position itself as the fabric that ties together the different clouds. Cloudflare sits atop of the other cloud infrastructure providers and is well suited for some AI workloads. Customers already include top AI companies and startups like OpenAI and Hugging Face. 

One example of this market positioning is Cloudflares object store called R2 (one less than Amazons object store called S3). Based on a market survey, it seems that S3 could be about a $1B revenue business (which almost equates to the entire revenue of Cloudflare today). 

Amazon makes a strategic move with S3 to charge users to move data off their cloud, but not charge to move data in. The costs to transfer out are known as egress fees, and this is inflated to cost users exponentially more than what it costs Amazon. Intuitively this does not make sense because Amazon made fixed cost investments to set up their network. Data travels in and out on the same fiber optic cables they laid out in the past. It doesnt make sense to charge different prices for data in vs data out since the underlying cost is the same and approaches 0. The key objective for Amazon is to lock you in. Amazon stands to benefit if customers pick them and over their competitors. Cloudflare on the other hand, actually wants to enable so called multi cloud systems, since it can serve as the control plane for data movement and capture that new market.

With egress fees it can be economically unviable to use multiple cloud providers. Say Microsoft has the best AI APIs because of their OpenAI tie up, but youre a user of AWS. Moving the data off AWS to use the Azure offering would cost a lot of money. Often times, training data sets are also massive, so moving them is even more costly. Cloudflare eliminates this cost and is slowly becoming a platform of choice for AI startups for this use case.

Another market that Cloudflare seems poised to capture a share of is what is known as inference, the act of AI models making conclusions and judgements. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it is doing inference. It is attempting to make a prediction based on all the training data it has. Most use cases of AI will likely be inference since you want the model to generate a response based on what you ask it. A lot of inference today occurs in the centralized data centers and high latency adversely impacts customer experience. When Cloudflare built out their network, every point of presence was built out with the same hardware and they even reserved a slot for GPUs, processors needed for AI workloads. Now, the network can easily be upgraded and retrofitted with GPUs with minimal additional capital expenditures. Cloudflare management thinks a lot of AI inference will likely happen closer to the end user, since it is not as demanding as training which has to be done in the centralized data center. 

We are seeing this inference cloud of sorts from Apple as well, further validating this idea. I need to read more, but Apples Private Cloud Compute they announced at WWDC will be a network of their own servers to offload some of the compute from iPhones for more intensive AI tasks. Apple predictably is doing this in house and has the advantage of using their own silicon. However, this proves that local devices arent necessarily powerful (RAM is the limiting factor) to run large models we use today.

Cloudflares edge network is beneficial in data governance/localization use cases as well. Some progressive governments have introduced data collection and privacy laws. In the EU there is GDPR, regulations that give users more control over their data. One trend developing is that nations are requiring data of their citizens to stay within their borders. This is a very costly problem to solve for many of the public clouds today (even Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). They would have to spend a lot of money to reconfigure how their data centers are set up and create new software to handle how that data is routed.

The last market expansion avenue Id like to highlight is Cloudflare Workers. Workers is a framework used to program Cloudflares edge network. There are many use cases for Workers and Cloudflare does not use it in its total addressable market estimates since it is so hard to estimate. One use case mentioned during Cloudflares investor day was Meta using it for WhatsApp. Each WhatsApp message is injected with some information used for authenticating the message by a Cloudflare Worker. This happens for billions of messages per day and really demonstrates its scale and versatility. I imagine Workers will be a huge driver of revenue at some point in the near future.

Workers AI was recently launched and seems like a very easy way for developers to build apps and connect services to Cloudflares network. I will be monitoring this and seeing if there are new apps launching that use this and would love to see the developer community explode here.

Valuation:

Cloudflares products strategically complement each other and are economically attractive because of the upfront financial and technical decisions that were made when the company was founded. 

Cloudflare benefits from a zero/low marginal cost structure that technology companies often benefit from. The high fixed cost investments (building servers and laying fiber optic cables to create the network) are slowly depreciated over time through the income statement and appear in the form of capital expenditures on the cash flow statement. The network also benefits from being incredibly efficient and operates at a high utilization rate where traffic is routed optimally. 

The company generates over 1.4B in ARR and is growing at around 30%. It operates at north of 75% gross margins and is slightly free cash flow positive, but some amount of shares are being issued to fund employee stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense is the unfortunate reality at most technology companies and many try to falsely claim profitability with adjusted figures where that cost is excluded.

On to the balance sheet, where there isnt a ton of capital in this business at only about ~2B. There is only about 700M worth of equity (assets - liabilities), meaning it trades at a massive premium at 35x equity. With a stock like this youre betting on very high revenue growth and the ability to earn an incredibly high return on invested capital and equity. Although there is network capex (about 10-12% of revenues), Cloudflare is still very asset light and its servers seem to be easily upgradable with minimal additional investment. As mentioned earlier, the foresight to equip every data center with the same hardware and even leaving a slot for GPUs really illustrates this point. The asset light model is advantageous because inflation always eats away earnings growth. If you need to keep putting up a lot of capital to simply operate your business youre really fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, given Cloudflares mission critical offerings of security, speed, and reliability, there is potential of eventual pricing power in my view. The consistent addition of new products and services also increase the value proposition and enables future price increases.

Despite all that, it is still very difficult to value this company because it implies the analyst can predict the earnings potential of the limited amount of capital that exists in the business. There is a lot of so called economic goodwill (not traditional accounting goodwill) in this business and it demands a price that is far in excess of what is measurable. However, given the cost structure, total addressable market, efficiency of the network, and strategic vision, I believe the revenue growth can be above 20% for the next 5 or so years and the company can achieve high levels of profitability. Serving an additional customer is not very costly and reaching greater scale results in greater profitability. In regards to competition, I think being the only vendor to offer products across a wide range of business needs is favorable. 

I did a simple DCF model where I attempt to value the company. Most of the value comes in the terminal stage, as this company is reinvesting back into the business to fund its growth ambitions and produces no meaningful cash today. The management team aims to generate $5B in revenue by the year 2026, which may be ambitious. I find it to be worth about $15B in todays dollars and that approximates the price I paid for it. I have added stock based compensation back in the cash flows and also increased the share count. Ive assumed most of the capex will eventually be maintenance capex. Cloudflare has proven with their architectural advantages that growth capex is fairly low. As a result, the net margin could be very similar to the free cash flow margin (lower if you add back SBC in FCF).

Management:

The CEO of Cloudflare is Matthew Prince who owns about 10% of the company. Prince has made brilliant strategic moves as discussed throughout this article and often sees things before they happen. The founding team was inspired by their professor at Harvard Business School, Clayton Christensen. Christensen is credited with one of the most influential business theories of all time: Dispruption Theory. His book, the Innovators Dilemma, discusses how many of the worlds largest companies over the course of history have faced an existential crisis leading to their fall from grace. This typically happens because incumbent companies are slow to adopt change. They ignore disruptive technologies that do not meet the needs of their main customers. These technologies improve over time and eventually overtake the existing technologies and its too late by the time incumbents adjust.
In Christensens terms, Cloudflare started as a classic low end disruption business model. They captured a large market share in networking and security products by offering their products for free. Now they are aiming to move up market to displace traditional security vendors and find a niche to coexist in the cloud infrastructure market dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. 

Concluding Thoughts: 

Cloudflare is a promising company that trades at an expensive price. I believe it is one of the few technology companies that can grow into its premium valuation over time and it remains one of my highest conviction companies. There is always risk and uncertainty when the companys value primarily stems from its terminal cash flows (and is also the only company in my portfolio with such an extreme setup).

Yesterday, it reached $244. I believe chips are still a great investment, even at this price, and I am continuing to buy more.

Along the way, many commenters have argued against chips, so this quarter I think I'd like to address the common themes I see in the comments, and explain why I think chips are still a great opportunity.

1: AI is a gimmick, or has very limited practical use, or is just a fancy auto-complete, and it won't drive growth in chips

This is probably the most common and upvoted argument I see. I have to guess that people making this argument either haven't experimented with AI themselves, or don't yet have a use for AI in their day to day lives.

For me, I use GitHub copilot every day. It is an incredible productivity boost. Developers that have used GitHub copilot understand how much value is there, and the rest of the world is just now catching up with things like Microsoft's recently announced Copilot+ (more on that in a minute). So if you want to argue that AI is a gimmick or fad, I'd ask that you also explain why you think millions of people will suddenly stop or decrease their use, rather than increase and expand their use of AI as it continues to get better.

2: We don't need more chips, soon there will be too much supply

Last time I saw this argument, I countered that even as data centers built up their AI capabilities, on-device demands were going to further strain supply. Since then, there have been several announcements about on-device chips, with Copilot+ (and the requirement of a chip that can do 40 TOPS) perhaps being the biggest and clearest example.

Very few devices today (laptops, phones, etc.) have enough processing power, or the right kind of processing power, to efficiently run a small LLM. Hence, the release of new chips like the M4 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, which were designed specifically to power small on-device LLMs. In my opinion, these chips are going to be a minimum system requirement going forward, and virtually every device will eventually be replaced with one that has one of these new chips.

3: It's a chip bubble, there's no fundamentals supporting the price

I'm a big believer in fundamental analysis, and if you look at chips through the lens of fundamental analysis, I see your point. NVDA is trading at over 60 P/E, and why would you buy that when there are other great companies trading at a much lower P/E.

The thing is, fundamental analysis is great for mature industries that are perhaps innovating on their operations, making them more efficient, but where there is not much actual product innovation. Fundamental analysis really breaks down when you have a rapidly evolving or completely novel product, a product so innovative it creates an all-new industry. For example, if you were thinking about investing in Amazon around 2010, fundamental analysis would have told you that the company is burning through cash, and their P/E ratio was in the high 60's, and that it wasn't a good value. Of course, the stock went on to grow by more than 20x since then. So much for fundamental analysis.

Fundamental analysis really falls short when it comes to new products that are so innovative they create their own industries. The companies creating these products tend to spend heavily on R",investing,54.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d08frq/still_obsessed_with_chip_makers_part_3/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9966228008270264

2024-02-10,1707602925.0,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,"\#AMDs MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I dont believe it will get close to Nvidias near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  
It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.

$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had ""good confidence"" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  
However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  
For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  
EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  
Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  
Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  
Guidance was light:  
Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  
Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  
Client Group - The recovery in PCs helped AMDs client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  
Gaming, which includes semi-custom processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMDs overall margins.  
AMDs embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.",stocks,129.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anrsxh/advanced_micro_devices_amd_171_a_good_long_term/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9828352332115173
2024-02-14,1707945403.0,Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move,"Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.

Its the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.

In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Heres how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected

Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected

Ciscos revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

2024-02-15,1707956054.0,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. Its the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmakers stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Googles $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques  such as transformer architecture  used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a code red situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

2024-02-16,1708107516.0,Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  
  
It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  
  
First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  
  
You could say its because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  
It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  
  
AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  
  
How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But its not just any Product. Its a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  
  
This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  
  
This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  
  
They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  
  
How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  
  
Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  
  
\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  
  
\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  
  
\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  
  
\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  
  
The Analogy:  
  
Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  
  
TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  
  
The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  
  
At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  
  
Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  
  
Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  
  
What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  
  
Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.  
  
\----  
  
NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  
  
Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and thats their moat. This tells me that the person doesnt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  
  
NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They only design them.  
  
Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? Its TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  
  
So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big Chip Design Company. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult moat part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  
  
There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  
  
So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  
  
Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  
  
AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  
  
Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime theyre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  
  
According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  
  
Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  
  
Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  
  
However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apples GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidias GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  
  
Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apples commitment to developing its own graphics technology. (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)  
  
Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:

 announced Wednesday that it will cut 5% of its workforce, part of a plan that includes reducing office space and ending work on some video games.

EA employed 13,400 workers as of the end of March 2023, according to its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May. That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.

The companys announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. 

On Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencents Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is streamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.

The cuts will support EAs strategic priorities and growth initiatives, according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be substantially complete by the end of December.

We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business, Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.

Wilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its biggest opportunities  including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities. 

During the companys third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.

*To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*  
  
*The final list of named trends we researched was:*  
  
*-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*  
  
*-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*  
  
*-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*  
  
*-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*  
  
*-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.*  
  
*-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.*  
  
*-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*  
  
*-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*  
  
*Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*  
  
*From first mention*  
  
*Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*  
  
*For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S",stocks,68.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b3xvkb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.6730677485466003

They seem way ahead of all other pure-RPA / automation platforms (blueprism, automation anywhere etc..). But multiple sources point out an increasing threat from microsoft. But when you get to read reports (i.e. gartner) + do a comparison between functionalities, microsoft power automate seem to be more of a ""nice to have"" product to complements the office suite rather than an end to end automation platform like UiPath. In that case, is microsoft really a threat there ?

* Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia said on Wednesday they had partnered up to offer the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients.

* The service will make it easier for companies to own artificial intelligence computing systems and have better control over their data, instead of renting out Nvidia's market-leading chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon.com or Microsoft.

* Many large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and requiring liquid cooling.

* Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.

* ""We want to drive privacy because what we're hearing at large customers is they are very worried about controlling their own destiny,"" Jon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, told Reuters in an interview.

* However, ""being able to then figure out how to operate (AI data centers) efficiently and effectively - this is an entirely new set of capabilities that is not generally available.""

* Nvidia and Equinix said the new offering is available as of Wednesday but did not disclose any immediate customers.

Will this have a big impact on the companies involved? Is there a real fear of Amazon losing customers?

2024-08-13,1723557921.0,Why Ouster (OUST) is winning the Lidar cage match,"**What is Lidar?**

* Chatbots are great, but Lidar is the key to unlocking AI's potential in the real world. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is like bat echolocation with lasers, for a precise 3D model of the surroundings.
* Humans are squishy! So autonomous machines must track their environment with 100% reliability. But cameras fail in certain conditions, as seen in this [Tesla dashcam](https://x.com/greentheonly/status/1473307236952940548).
* Ouster has honed the long-term winning type of Lidar.

**Why OUST's variant of Lidar is the future**

* OUST specializes in [multi-beam flash Lidar](https://ouster.com/insights/blog/how-multi-beam-flash-lidar-works), which enjoys structural advantages in cost, compactness, durability and power efficiency. Historically, it lacked the range of legacy designs with moving parts. However, OUST has finally closed this performance gap. 
* OUST's approach uniquely benefits from advancements in the consumer electronics industry, which drives down costs while improving performance, a-la Moores law. See: laser printers, fiber optics, VR headsets, FaceId, fitness trackers and smart glasses.
* Ousters DF2 sensor has 240 meters of range and will be sold for automotive use in 2025.

**A clear path to profitability**

* OUST sells to customers across 15 industries, versus relying on one aspirational auto partnership. This creates stable revenue and strong pricing power, generating the cash to achieve automotive-grade performance. Their sensors already power [Amazons latest warehouse robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/OUST/comments/15upziw/amazon_robot_fleet_and_how_its_extending_to/).
* OUST already makes money on each LiDAR unit sold, with +29% gross margin in 1Q24. Whereas their US competitors lose money on every LiDAR unit sold (i.e., gross margins below -80%).
* Last year, they launched a complementary software product (BlueCity) with recurring, high-margin revenue. Customers love it because it reduces the time-to-value for OUST sensors.
* OUST is close to breakeven, with $4.7m in cash outflow in 1Q24 and $189m in cash reserves. So they wont need to raise debt or significantly dilute shareholders, unlike competitors with huge interest payments and quarters of runway left.

**Attractive entry price, with insiders buying ahead of todays earnings release**

* OUST shares fell 33% since mid-July for no fundamental reason. Just the Yen carry trade unwind and terrible 2Q earnings from Lidar competitors. Like [Luminar Technologies (LAZR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR/) who reported a 22% sequential rev decline, dilutive debt restructuring, new debt with a 14% interest rate and -88% gross margins.
* Insiders doubled-down on OUST by [buying shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/oust/insider-activity) on May 15th, halfway the quarter whose results come out later today.
* OUST guided to $110m revenue for 2024 (+40% y/y), gross margins in the mid-high 30s and profitability by year end. **Given they beat guidance the past three quarters, todays market cap of $500m may never be seen again.**

**Risks to thesis:**

* While Hesai (HSAI), a Chinese manufacturer, enjoys higher revenue thanks to automotive contracts, their 2Q revenue declined y/y and the US military labeled them a national security risk.
* OUST lacks major automotive partnerships, which can generate huge amounts of recurring revenue upon commercialization. However, their first sensor optimized for this space, DF2, will be sold in 2025.
* A recession could slow down investments in industrial automation, delaying their path to profitability and requiring shareholder dilution. On the flip side, this would probably kill their debt-laden, negative gross margin competitors.
* Stock is up 56% YTD still! But this seems warranted given repeated revenue beats, gross margin expansion and a successful merger (Velodyne) with $120m in cost savings ahead of schedule.

Even if Ivy is efficient and only uploads 1% of data instead of 100%(how its done today), Amazon loses big. 

Amazon makes more money in aws storage then blackberry Ivy. Bb Ivy with say 100 million installs in year 2030-2035, will generate about 2 billion a year. That divided in half is only 1 billion for Amazon minus cost. Aws brings in 143 billion!!!!!! 

Why would Amazon want to sacrifice aws revenue by advertising Ivy that can cut off their revenue ? 


John Chen and blackbrrry made a huge mistake by partnering with Amazon. Amazon has zero interest in promoting Ivy. Even Amazon webpage for Ivy is dud. 

Ivy needs to be sold off or just shut down and bb needs to focus on cyber and iot.

2024-02-01,1706803979.0,2024 One Month Reflection,"Coming into 2024 there were hopes of six rate cuts.  Institutions started positioning themselves into small caps in November and December thinking the rate cuts will drive small caps.  Tech had such a great year last year, but most of the gains were from losses in 2022.

Based on chairman Powell's remarks yesterday it is unlikely we see a rate cut in march.  That is when we started to see another selloff.  Besides the rate cuts probably not happening until May their is also risk in the regional banking sector when they start realizing the losses in commercial real estate. 

There is also instability in the Middle East which is affecting shipping.  Oil prices have not gone up yet due to this conflict.  As long as the conflict is contained and does not start to grow I don't see this being a big issue.  

Tech earnings started to come in and it has been a mixed bag so far.  SMCI is showing great strength from the AI boom.  AMD's Lisa SU said,We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history  Microsoft reported 30% growth in Azure revenue.

Based on this information the broader market should start to  do better around April leading into the May Fed meeting.  There is risk if we don't see the rate cuts in May which are not guaranteed.  I would stay out of the regional banks even if their are cuts due to the commercial real estate risk.  Hopefully this will not bleed over to ther areas of the economy.   Lastly I think tech will continue to outperform for at least a few years due to the early AI cycle.  This is going to lead to PC sales, data center, and cellular phone sales, to name a few that will see growth due to everyone upgrading for the AI technology.  Growth in the income will start to then reflect in the stocks.",stocks,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1agem31/2024_one_month_reflection/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9938638210296631

Now what? Well it's finally time, Expedia is releasing their earnings today. Yes, I've been looking forward to this one. For those who don't know, they're a travel company providing everything from airline tickets, hotel rooms, and car rentals, to cruises. Last earnings, Expedia beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $2.89 billion, up 8.4% year on year. It was an ok quarter, with solid growth in its bookings but slow revenue growth. It reported 101.2 million nights booked, up 7.1% year on year. So what are we going to do for today's earnings? Why am I getting puts? 

I expect Expedias stock to likely see little to no movement with revenues and earnings matching consensus estimates in Q2 results, and as a result the stock will most likely drop after hours today. We have to keep in mind that the company will benefit from increasing travel demand that has remained resilient despite macro-economic issues. The B2B and B2C segment has performed well for the companys retail side in terms of growth, while also driving margins higher. However, Vrbo segments recovery post-technical migration was slower than expected, impacting the overall performance in Q1. Vrbo is the vacation rentals portion of the company. Expedia expects its full-year revenue growth to be lower than initially anticipated for 2024, prompting a revision of the full-year guidance to a range of mid- to high single-digit top-line growth. Take a look tho, Expedias stock is down 23% so far YTD. In comparison, Expedias peer Booking Holdings (BKNG) stock fell 3% year-to-date to $3417.

From what I've read, analysts are expecting Expedia's revenue to grow 5.2% year on year to $3.53 billion this quarter, in line with the 5.6% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $3.16 per share.

A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the companys workforce.

We regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy, the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. As part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.

Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.

The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.

As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.

Last month, Microsoft
 cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google
 said its eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon
 laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.

In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta
 announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that its laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.

Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zooms stock has stumbled.

Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.

Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the uncertainty of the global economy, CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.

They've been expanding beyond stock trading into credit cards, retirement accounts, and other financial services. When the brokerage firm reports second-quarter earnings after the market close today, we'll finally get the chance to get an idea on how those new efforts are doing.

Analysts are guessing the company will report pretty strong second quarter earnings growth, looking for earnings per share of 16 cents on revenue of $640 million. That compares with earnings of just 3 cents and revenue of $486 million for the second quarter of 2023.

We need to keep in mind that this earnings report lands at a very volatile moment right now in markets, with a sharp sell-off in equities earlier this week. Shares of Robinhood have dropped like a rock - 24% over the past month. This has erased quite a bit of the stocks substantial run-up earlier this year.

2024-02-07,1707342208.0,"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales","Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Heres how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and its more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arms license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected

Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected


For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.

Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.

AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidias H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the companys data center segment over the next few years.

In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.

But historically, AMDs main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.

Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. Its now firmly AMDs largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to strong growth for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.

However, AMDs overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.

AMDs client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

Sales in AMDs gaming segment, which includes semi-custom processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

AMDs embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

Were all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, its a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations& \[1\]

More and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \[2\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \[3\], WEF \[4\], Yale \[5\]& etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power. 

SMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (youll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor. 

IMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \~$3b. This cost would later balloon to \~$9b, of which the government would help with about 50%. At worst lets say the first round cost $10b and no government funding. This has always been the largest hurdle to nuclear power plant development, upfront costs.

In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMCs performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.*

*TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.*

*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*

*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*

*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*

*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*

*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*

While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

Alright, so Nvidia is crazy overvalued right now. Just check out its P/E ratio  it's sitting at a whopping 73.94. And that's not all. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.55, and the price-to-sales ratio is over 42. These numbers are way above what you typically see for tech stocks and the semiconductor industry. There are two big reasons why Nvidia's stock might take a hit: growing competition and lowered margins.

**Growing Competition**

First off, the competition is heating up big time. =% AMD's MI300 series is a beast, merging CPU and GPU on the same chip, which is great for performance and energy efficiency. This is super important for data centers and AI applications, and it could seriously cut into Nvidia's market share. AMD is coming in hot, and Nvidia might end up feeling the burn. Then you've got Intel with their Gaudi3 GPU, which is packing some serious performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks. More people might start switching to Intel's GPUs, giving Nvidia a run for its money. Intel's Gaudi3 could be the ghost in Nvidia's machine={ 

**Lowered Margins**

Then there's Amazon, which is throwing its hat into the ring with custom GPUs for their EC2 instances. These GPUs are optimized for machine learning and AI, and they integrate perfectly with Amazon's cloud services. This seamless integration could mean less reliance on Nvidia's products, pushing Nvidia to cut prices to stay competitive. Lower prices mean lower margins, which isn't great for Nvidia's bottom line. Amazon could very well turn Nvidia's margins into margin call memes. =É

2024-06-20,1718917643.0,"My Thesis on IonQ
","Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.

# Stock Performance

First off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so theres definitely room for growth.

# What's New with IonQ?

IonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and its a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.

# Management Changes

Theyve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the companys strategy and growth. Plus, theyve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.

# Industry Positioning

IonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platformsAmazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means theyre super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.

# Financials

Financially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. Theyve got a lot of cash on hand$434.4 millionso theyre in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.

# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?

Now, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If youre looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Heres why:

1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.
2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but theyre not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.
3. **Valuation**: IonQs stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIAs, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.

In summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.",wallstreetbets,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dkmiva/my_thesis_on_ionq/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9522701501846313

2024-06-20,1718894769.0,NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so. ,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter well see just 7%. 

All of the marginal buyers are in  sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests  short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, when the ducks are quacking, feed them. 

If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well  making the stock become more and more expensive (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the cheaper it got. 

This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader  which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. Its just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). 

NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business  its cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, your margin is my opportunity. NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intels Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDAs H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company. NVDA is a great company and will continue to innovate. We are in an AI/productivity revolution. I would never bet against it. However&

Price is what you pay, value is what you get& Caveat emptor at these levels. What may go even higher in the short term can go a lot lower in a blink. The table is set

2024-06-17,1718635771.0,StoneCo ($STNE): The Great South American Short Story,"Ladies and germs, lend me your rears. It's time for the next Great South American short story. But first, please note that this is NOT financial advice. It is however a work of utter genius, to be regarded in retrospect as a pioneering tract in the oeuvre of market literature. 

TL;DR: StoneCo is a fairly dope SA fintech company with quality financials yet rapidly increasing short interest. The dumb fucks who think they can chip away at this little gem deserve to be eaten alive by the intrepid marketeers going in on shares and OTM calls. 

StoneCo is a Brazilian fintech platform that serves SMBs with payments, loans, and now general banking services. Warren Buffett formerly held this stock in Berkshire, but divested sometime in 2023, about a year and change after a moderate crisis with their loan book. Long story short, they screwed up with some regulatory features and saw a ton of debts go bad. 

After recalibrating, the company returned to rapid growth and, better yet, significant profitability. The share price appreciated in kind. However, following their recent earnings report, the company has seen a surge in short interest (https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-stne-options-data-report-2024-06-15/#google\_vignette). 

With fairly impressive numbers since going public--2021 crisis notwithstanding--the only explanations for short pressure are:

1. Increase in credit offerings has investors nervous about a crisis repeat. StoneCo has however installed ample loan loss reserves and bad loans are in line with or below industry averages.

2. The company's CEO and chairman left last year. Their departure, somewhat unexplained, could be worrying investors.

3. Revenue growth slowed to ""only"" 14% YoY--not really all that shabby considering their comps for growth were in the mid/high double digits.  

Meanwhile, earnings increased 65% YoY, as management has only started to optimize ARPU. The cross selling between payments, credit, and banking will continue to accelerate margin expansion and, therefore, earnings growth. Even if StoneCo settles at a 10% revenue growth long term--quite a conservative estimate for a company in an industry seeing 17% CAGR--margin expansion will assure 15%+ earnings growth. 

Their main competitor is likely Mercado Libre--the Amazon of South America--which has also muscled into the fintech space with great results thus far. There are a couple of others, but the market opportunity is massive, well more than enough to go around for the top players in the industry. The bad loan book aside, management has done a fantastic job, and it's difficult to imagine them not keeping apace with industry growth averages. 

$STNE now trades at under 12X TTM earnings, and less than 8X forward earnings. For a quality organization in a booming industry that just posted 65% growth, that's fucking cheap. The shorts have come in with the idea that they can scare investors away. 

As LeBron notoriously proclaimed, ""It's time to take our talents to South America.""

Now called Meta Horizon OS, the open system allows developers to access technologies like eye, face, hand, and body tracking, high-resolution passthrough, and more.

Three major tech playersAsus, Lenovo and Microsofts Xboxare the first companies to confirm theyll be developing new devices that run the software. Most notably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox, according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for productivity, learning, and entertainment.

The company says all future headsets can connect via the same Meta Quest app on iOS and Android. Plus, the Meta Quest Store, which the company renamed the Meta Horizon Store, is open to third-party developers, allowing them to use Metas frameworks and tools to create new mixed-reality experiences.

Meta Horizon OS is a strategic move for the company and comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up.

2024-04-23,1713900859.0,HashiCorp shares spike on report that IBM is in talks to buy the company,"HashiCorp shares jumped as much as 26% on Tuesday following a media report claiming IBM was in talks to acquire the cloud software maker.

Developers use HashiCorps software to set up and manage infrastructure in public clouds that companies such as Amazon and Microsoft operate. Organizations also pay HashiCorp for managing security credentials.

Citing unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal said a deal could materialize in the next few days.

HashiCorp and IBM representatives both told CNBC they do not comment on market rumors or speculation.

Founded in 2012, HashiCorp went public on Nasdaq in 2021. The company generated a net loss of nearly $191 million on $583 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, according to its annual report. In December, Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder of HashiCorp, whose family name is reflected in the company name, announced that he was leaving.

Revenue jumped almost 23% during that period, compared with 2% for IBM in 2023. IBM executives pointed to a difficult economic climate during a conference call with analysts in January. The hardware, software and consulting provider reports earnings on Wednesday.

Cisco held $9 million in HashiCorp shares at the end of March, according to a regulatory filing. Cisco held early acquisition talks with HashiCorp, according to a 2019 report.

IBM shares slipped after publication of the Wall Street Journal article but quickly recovered.

(Copilot+ PC by Microsoft, Apple Intelligence by well apple) As far as I see, Qcom's latest X elite is not the best in any of the benchmarks but it is decent on a completely new market for them which is efficient PC market btw.

2024-03-05,1709671099.0,"Talk to me like I'm five - AI, and ebbs/flows in the stock market","TLDR I have done incredibly well in the market in the past 17 months and want to educate myself about the intricacies of the ebbs and flows of stocks. Any good suggestions for starting places to learn?


I pulled our 401k's (2040 target) in November 2022. Started with $90k in Amazon and then started liquidating other 401k's (we're in tech and switch jobs every couple/few years). I continued investing in everything AI adjacent, including Nvidia, palantir, c3, meta (wife worked there), Microsoft, AMD, super micro (didn't get in on this until this mid Feb), and a few others. I bought Amazon because I think they're future looks bright and didn't see it performing worse than the 2040 fund and then I basically just kept buying stocks related to AI.

Long story short, pulling out of those dog poop funds was the best financial decision I ever made. 

We're not touching any of these stocks for at least 15 years (even the ones in our brokerage account) because 1) we're 50ish and 2) I look at companies like Microsoft where even if you had invested at the top of the dot.com bubble, if you hadn't touched i the stock, you'd still be in great shape despite major market downtowns along the way. 

Now having said all that, I look at this portfolio every day, and aside from a couple company's earnings calls, it looks to my untrained eye that it's a lot of speculation based on a collective assumption of future growth in AI and that I just got in early. 

I know this is a stretch to ask on Reddit, but even with these 1-5% daily gains that I think are coming from people and institutions still racing to get their money into AI, what is triggering declines like today (-.2.5%)? Is it large blocks of money taking profits out, or people selling because they have set up some kind of triggers to get ahead of a declining market, or a million other things (most likely)?

Even though I don't plan on ""day trading"", I'd like to learn more about what's causing these ebbs and flows of money and I don't feel like anything on TV (and most of the ""shows"" on the Internet) give us an unbiased view of what's really going on. Any suggestions of where to start learning?

2024-03-08,1709912448.0,Is Intel (INTC) Undervalued?,"I was looking at the various chip makers to see how they compare to each other and especially NVDA. Intel has had a few rocky quarters in mid 2022 to mid 2023, but it seems like they could be also on the verge of a turn around. They recently signed a 15 billion dollar deal with Microsoft, and they're currently in negotiations to make chips for the US military.

**Key stats for NVDA**

* Yearly Revenue: 44.87B
* Net Income: 18.88B
* PE Ratio: 80
* Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 33.3B
* Market Cap: 2.38T

**Key stats for INTC**

* Yearly Revenue: 54.23B
* Net Income: 1.69B
* PE Ratio: 114
* Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 110B
* Market Cap: 195B

Effectively what this means is that Intel has more revenue, more shareholder equity, and 1/10 the market cap of NVDA. Their profitability took a huge hit in 2022, but their most recent quarters have seen them return to net positive. A bet on NVDA at this point seems to be a bet on continued parabolic growth and long term sustainability of their insane profit margins. On the other hand, it seems like Intel is undervalued and poised as a possible underdog to step up and take some market share. If the chip sector continues its rally then it seems like INTC could be a good bet. If the entire chip sector crashes and burns, Intel's potential downside is very low, with their stock price only 77% above book value.

2024-03-14,1710421012.0,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. Its quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that its the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars. - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely Automotive Sales, Services and Others, Automotive Lease, Automotive Regulatory Credit and Energy Generation and Storage sales. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLAs vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world. -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLAs manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesnt believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLAs network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicings pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, Direct Vehicle Operations Lease which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. Direct Sales Lease either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLAs affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce. ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces. ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t",stocks,72.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bekj4k/tesla_tsla_dcf_analysis/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9994679093360901

2024-03-18,1710793879.0,Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year,"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidias developers conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.

Nvidias share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAIs ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidias high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.

The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.

Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the companys developer conference in San Jose, California. Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.

The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.

Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.

The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways, said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. Of course, we still do that. But whats really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.

Das said Nvidias new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidias GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.

If youre a developer, youve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, well make sure that its runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people, Das said.

Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the companys Hopper architecture  used by chips such as the H100  which was announced in 2022.

Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.

The chip includes what Nvidia calls a transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.

The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.

Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. Thats much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.

Nvidia didnt provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems its used in. Nvidias Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.

Nvidia also announced its adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.

NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.

The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.

Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.

In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead, Das said.

Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

2024-07-01,1719798810.0,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by years end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which theyve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they dont settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidias stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didnt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldnt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidias place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasnt happened and Nvidias only gotten stronger.

Thats not to say over time Nvidia wont lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, its not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I dont think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

2024-03-06,1709743069.0,"If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM","Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright. 

Background: In late September 2020, [Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai) for $40 billion. At that time, NVDA was \~ $400 billion company, 10x the value of ARM. In December 2021, the [FTC sues to block the merger](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger) citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race. On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce [the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) and Softbank immediately announced plans to IPO ARM. ARM would IPO in September of 2023. 

All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on [ARM architecture](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/11/09/how-arm-gained-chip-dominance-with-apple-nvidia-amazon-and-qualcomm.html) and Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall. Jensen also knows that his main competitors, including some of the big boys, are also champing at the bit to either get their own stake or prevent Nvidia from cornering the entire market outright. It's a race against the inevitable. 

If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.

2024-08-14,1723617465.0,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now youre probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now youre probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing. 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you dont personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didnt decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor but Apple isnt cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Ok lets keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you dont use their products you personally know someone who uses them. Theyre everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and its expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels havent been seen since 2018.

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but Nike isnt cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why its down. Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowes

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home youre familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing youre paying attention to these two companies as theyre crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowes. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowes stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowes down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe youre not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and its only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease its only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and theyre causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally dont think so. However I think going forward we wont see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts.

2024-08-19,1724073141.0,AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

AI systems are our number one strategic priority, AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs, Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMDs data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the companys developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The companys customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the companys adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

Product revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflakes business, will be $850 million to $855 million in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, predicted $848 million, although some estimates exceeded $900 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its fiscal year product sales forecast to $3.36 billion from $3.3 billion.

Under Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has launched products focused on generative AI and other new ways to analyze large sets of data. The strategy is fueled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc. and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake offers software that helps customers find, organize and use huge amounts of information from a variety of sources.

Ramaswamy touted product delivery, and great traction in the early stages of our new AI products.

Still, Snowflake is navigating a challenging environment between a recent CEO change, security breaches of its customers and some market shift to products outside its traditional wheelhouse, wrote Derrick Wood, an analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the results.

In the fiscal second quarter, total revenue rose 29% to $868.8 million  coming in under 30% for the first time in Snowflakes history as a publicly traded company.

The shares declined about 7% in extended trading after closing at $135.06 in New York. The stock has dropped 32% this year, as investors have been concerned about Snowflakes ability to catch up in AI-oriented tools.

2024-03-13,1710288184.0,The Next NYCB?,"I saw this table with the regional banks most exposed to commercial real estate and the one that really popped out to me was Bank OZK. Their exposure not just to RE, but to CONSTRUCTION is enormous.

Construction loans are inherently riskier than loans on existing assets because there is no income or profit to the lender until construction is complete. If they can't sell the building for what they thought they could (pretty safe to assume now that the real estate market is belly-up for offices, life sciences, hotels, and lots of multifamily), then they're not paying the full loan back. It's also harder to tell when a default is coming because there aren't regular payments that can be missed like with a mortgage. Developers also historically will keep aggressively drawing down loans to keep the lights on when they don't have any other cash coming in.

OZK talks about their low LTV ratios for their loans, but assumptions have changed dramatically in the real estate world due to higher-for-longer interest rates. For example, if the cap rate on a property increases from 5% to 7%, that equates to a 28.5% decrease in value, meaning a conservative LTV ratio of 50% can very quickly climb to 70% just on that one metric.

Scanning around for OZK's loans I see a bunch that look risky already.

1. A $242M construction loan for a huge office tower in Denver that's about to complete but is only 4% preleased
2. A $97M loan for a million sf logistics center in Glendale AZ where rents just fell by 6.9% due to so much new construction
3. $265M for Nashville Yards, an office complex where Amazon announced it was pausing construction on it's own office tower
4. $265M for 23Springs office development in Dallas. The only reason this development was able to move forward with construction was that Bank OZK *themselves* preleased 110,000 sf of space.

OZK lent out $13.8B in 2022, the absolute top of the market for real estate, compared to just $6.6B in 2020 and $7.9B in 2021. Seems to me that the underwriting assumptions were probably way too optimistic given the current real estate recession we're in. Might take a while to play out but it feels like only a matter of time before people discover the odorous pile of excrement they have assembled.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF todays stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramers high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors headlong rush into the American chipmakers shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidias artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the worlds most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that titleand $900bn in valueamid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang? Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidias boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn.

Here is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $1.04 adjusted vs. 97 cents expected

Revenue: $963.9 million vs. $959 million expected

CrowdStrikes revenue grew 32% year over year in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. The company recorded net income of $47 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with $8.47 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Annual recurring revenue was $3.86 billion, just above the StreetAccount consensus of $3.85 billion.

On July 19, CrowdStrike distributed a flawed content configuration update for its Falcon sensor to computers running Microsoft
 Windows operating systems, with the intent to gather data on new attacks. The error caused millions of computers to crash, leading to flight cancelations, delayed packaged deliveries and postponed medical appointments. Administrators had to manually reboot affected computers.

CEO George Kurtz apologized to clients and partners and said the company had rolled out a fix. Meanwhile, investors were pushing down CrowdStrikes share price. Shareholders have filed suit against the company, and Delta Air Lines
, which cited $380 million in lost revenue and $170 million in costs because of the incident, said it will seek damages. Travelers have filed class-action suits against the CrowdStrike as well.

All customers are looking for some kind of discount, Gray Powell and Trevor Rambo of BTIG, with the equivalent of a hold rating on CrowdStrike shares, wrote in an Aug. 23 note.

With respect to guidance, CrowdStrike called for adjusted net earnings of 80 cents to 81 cents per share on $979.2 million to $984.7 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for 96 cents in adjusted net earnings per share on $1.01 billion in revenue.

For the 2025 fiscal year, CrowdStrike now sees $3.61 to $3.65 in adjusted earnings per share and $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion in revenue. Thats down from managements June forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.03 and revenue between $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected adjusted profit of $3.88 per share, with $3.95 billion in revenue.

The full-year revenue guidance includes a negative subscription revenue impact of $30 million in each quarter and professional services revenue in the high-single-digit millions of dollars for the second half of the fiscal year, because of incentives for a customer commitment package, according to the statement. The adjusted guidance excludes costs related to the outage, CrowdStrike said.

2024-08-29,1724936385.0,Best Buy shares jump on profit beat and guidance hike ,"Best Buy raised its fiscal-year profit guidance Thursday after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations for the most recent quarter.

The retailer now expects to see full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.10 to $6.35, up from a prior range of $5.75 to $6.20. The company, however, lowered the top end of its guidance ranges for both full-year revenue and comparable sales.

As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our industry to continue to show increasing stabilization, Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said in the companys press release.

Shares of Best Buy jumped more than 14% in premarket trading Thursday.

Heres how the consumer electronics retailer did for the period ended August 3 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.34 vs. $1.16 expected

Revenue: $9.29 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

The company reported net income for the quarter of $291 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with $274 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales in the quarter dropped to $9.29 billion from $9.58 billion during the same period a year earlier.

Comparable sales declined 2.3% during the quarter, compared with a 6.2% decline a year earlier.

Best Buy has been in the midst of an attempted turnaround in response to a two-year sales slump. Discretionary merchandise retailers across the board have struggled with softer consumer demand in the wake of unusually high sales throughout the Covid pandemic and as consumers pullback due to high inflation.

As the much-awaited replacement cycle of pandemic-era tech purchases starts trickling in, the retailer is hoping to cash in through marketing and operational initiatives. Best Buy said in July that it would add trained sales teams to three key parts of its stores  computing, appliance, and home theater  and kick off a marketing campaign that includes YouTube videos to draw consumer interest.

The company was also betting on a wave of new tech gadget debuts, such as a collection of new iPads launched by Apple in May and artificial intelligence-enabled laptops touted by Microsoft, to drive sales.

The company on Thursday posted comparable sales growth of 6% in the domestic tablet and computing categories. However, that was more than offset by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming, executives said.

We capitalized on demand driven by our customers desire to replace or upgrade their products, combined with new innovation, CEO Corie Barry said during the companys earnings call. We see a consumer who is seeking value in sales events and one who is also willing to spend on high-price-point products when they need to or when there is new, compelling technology.

Barry said AI could continue to boost sales across categories over the next few years.

We believe we are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand, she said.

Rivian started offering leasing for its R1S SUV in January, which could be a major catalyst for the company.

Tesla Model 3: 17.6%
VW ID.4: 3.9%
Mustang Mach-E: 3.4%
R1S: 3.4%

It, however, is within reach of making the list of the top three bestsellers if momentum can continue. The R1S was also the seventh-bestselling electric vehicle in the United States for all of 2023.

Rivian's reasonable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8 at the end of 2023 still gives it room to take on more debt as it scales up its business. It might struggle to issue more debt at favorable interest rates in this challenging market, but it probably won't go bankrupt within the next few years.

Rivian can overcome its near-term challenges as it ramps up production of its own in-house Enduro drive unit (which should reduce its production costs and dependence on third-party suppliers), rolls out its new R2 SUV in March, and chips away at Amazon's long-term order for 100,000 electric delivery vans.

Also, Amazon still hasn't sold its big stake in Rivian -- even as the latter's tumbling stock price weighs down the tech titan's near-term profits. R2, its next-generation vehicle, is being unveiled this week, and a lot is riding on the launch. A $5 billion plant in Georgia will construct the vehicle and, if successful, could drive Rivian to profitability in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

Bears case

Morgan Stanley said it expects further reduction in the company's unit costs this year and Q4 could see a breakeven in gross margin, but this would require ""substantial"" re-engineering in its vehicle models and improvements to material costs and purchased components.

The investment firm also noted that Rivian could reconsider its capital spending given the current landscape of the electric vehicle market. The company could also explore collaborating with peers to share costs and improve efficiencies, Morgan Stanley added. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Rivian Automotive (RIVN.NaE), whiling lowering its price target to $14 from $24.

Simply put, Rivian hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet. In 2023, it generated $4.43 billion in revenue by delivering 50,122 vehicles, but only narrowed its operating loss from $6.86 billion to $5.74 billion. That equals an average operating loss of about $114,500 per vehicle.

For 2024, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to rise 11% to $4.92 billion as it delivers more vehicles amid flat production, but they believe it will only decrease its operating loss to $4.82 billion.

Rivian ended 2023 with $10.47 billion in total liquidity, which includes its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and revolving credit facility. But it also generated negative free cash flow (FCF) of $5.89 billion in 2023, and it's expected to post negative FCF of $4.43 billion in 2024. Therefore, the company could easily burn through nearly half of its cash this year and be forced to raise additional funds through more debt and stock offerings as its vehicle production stalls out. That ugly balance sheet will also likely keep investors on the sidelines as long as interest rates stay elevated.

TLDR: So for now, I think investors should still hold Rivian's stock if they already own it, but they shouldn't start a new position until it stabilizes its core business and more green shoots appear.

Positions: 4246 stocks in Fidelity and 1155 stocks in RH at a total overage of $13.10 ($70, 755). A lot is riding on this and just might become long term hold depending on next few days.

2024-09-06,1725583329.0,Salesforce to acquire startup Own for $1.9 billion in cash ,"Salesforce announced Thursday that it would pay $1.9 billion in cash for Own Co., a startup specializing in tools for backing up data in cloud-based applications. Salesforce intends to close the deal in the quarter ending in January 2025 if regulators give it their blessing, according to a statement.

The startup, formerly known as OwnBackup, was valued at $3.35 billion in a 2021 funding round. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud software companys venture arm, invested in that round and earlier ones.

The proposed deal would mark the return of sizable deals for Salesforce, less than two years after co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said the board was eliminating a committee on mergers and acquisitions.

Benioffs pronouncement came after activist investors bought stakes in Salesforce and raised questions about profitability after the company had splurged on expensive assets, including MuleSoft and Slack, without delivering major growth in return.

The decline in value for Own reflects a more sluggish backdrop for software companies.

In late 2021, investors became less interested in cloud software, which had seen a surge in adoption in 2020 thanks to remote-work policies instituted after Covid. Central banks raised rates to ward off inflation, prompting money-losing cloud companies to focus more on profitability. Enterprises aiming to slim down information-technology budgets consolidated their purchases, burdening single-product companies, including startups and publicly traded companies.

Anaplan, Avalara, Coupa, Everbridge, Qualtrics, Sumo Logic and Zendesk all went private.

Own, which had specialized in helping Salesforce clients, sought to diversify. In its 2021 funding announcement, it touted its intent to work with Microsofts Dynamics enterprise software that competes with Salesforces core applications. Support for ServiceNow followed.

Salesforce in recent weeks has also revealed plans to buy smaller startups PredictSpring and Tenyx.

Salesforce said the Own acquisition wouldnt impact Salesforces shareholder return initiatives, and said the deal would be accretive to free cash flow starting in the second year after the deal closes.

In April, data-management software maker Informatica said it was not in talks to be acquired after media outlets reported Salesforce was interested in buying the company for around $10 billion.

Were going to be looking at products organically, but, yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically, Benioff told analysts on Salesforces May earnings call. But as weve committed to you, if were looking at a large-scale acquisition, were going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that its accretive, that it has the right metrics.

2024-08-26,1724705428.0,Still meaningful alpha left in NVIDIA?,"Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)

P.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals

Nvidia is the worlds largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant 98% market share in Data Center GPUs.
Last fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.
I believe theres a ~50% upside in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidias Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to $200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidias typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.
Key Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:
1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.
    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 yearsmuch of it allocated to AI and GPUs.
    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.
    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.
2. Supply Chain Insights: Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect
    * TSMCs CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidias Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024a ~3x increase.
    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.
    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.
    * AMDs CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030
3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:
    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.",stocks,130.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1ywwc/still_meaningful_alpha_left_in_nvidia/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9749003648757935
2024-09-06,1725635922.0,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

Were all busy you dont have time to read filler words and I dont care to write them.  Also posting on Easter Weekend so you can say youre working and read this instead of spending time with relatives.  Here goes. 

TKO group describes themselves as a premium sports and entertainment company that comprises the UFC and WWE.   

On September 12, 2023 Endeavour group (the then owner of UFC) and WWE closed a transaction to combine the two entities to form a new, publicly listed company (TKO group holdings).  Endeavour Group Holding (also publicly traded btw) remains majority shareholder with 51% of outstanding shares. 

Unfortunately, there is not much data that I could find on the combined group.  Financials that I found cover only January 1, 2023  December 31, 2023 for UFC and September 12, 2023  December 31, 2023 for the combined WWE and UFC.  Parent financials for are available for through Endeavour Group Holdings dating back only to 2021.  WWE financial reports are available back to 2000 as it was a separate publicly traded company.

History:
Both the UFC and WWE are household names and represent the most well recognized franchises in combat sports and wrestling entertainment respectively.  Additionally, both companies have long operating histories.  For reference the UFC just celebrated its 30th anniversary having hosted its first fight in 1993 and will be celebrating the UFC 300 event this coming April.  The WWE dates back even further, tracing its origins back to the 1950s being founded by either the father or grandfather of the well-known (and now somewhat infamous) figurehead Vince McMahon according to Wikipedia. 

About the business:
Under the new combined company the UFC and WWE will operate us separate entities.  The UFC will led by Dana White, who has served as president of the UFC since 2001 and grown it to a multibillion dollar business.  The WWE being led by Nick Kahn who joined the  WWE in 2020 and took over the role of President in 2021.

Per their 10K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 TKO group generates revenue from principal activities:

1. Media rights and content.
2. Live events.
3. Sponsorship.
4. Consumer products licensing.

1. Media and content:
TKO generates revenue from licensing live events and original programming to broadcasters domestically and internationally that carry TKO programming on digital and linear channels as well as pay-per-view.

These contracts last 35 years with broadcasters but they have some significant agreements lasting 710 years.

Broadcasters that have contracts with WWE or UFC include: ESPN, ABC, Comcast, Fox, Peacock, Tencent, Sony, Warner Brothers and now Netflix. 

Programming includes long and short for content, reality, series, and other filmed entertainment. Furthermore, TKO not only sells to distributors but also sells direct to consumers through UFC fight pass and WWE network.

2. Live events:
Live events generate revenue generation through ticket sales, site, fees, travel packages, and VIP experiences.

Between WWE and UFC generate 350 annual live events per year

3. Sponsorships:
TKO generates ad revenue and sponsorship revenue from sale of in-venue and in broadcasting advertising assets and digital impressions.

Ad revenues are driven by original content on third party social media platforms. For example, WWE has 100 million subscribers on YouTube and is the 12th most followed channel.

First of all we need to discuss what could AI potentially mean for our future and what implications it might have.

To my best of knowledge from reading various statements and articles, AI is going to take a big chunk of jobs across all of the sectors.

Logistics

Teslas Cybertruck will have an option of following one another and therefore youll have a fleet of trucks, commandeered by one driver whos first in the convoy, cruising on a highway
Tesla is already mapping all the roads to perfection before the commercial usage of cybertrucks to its fullest.

Automation of factory jobs

Theres activist already actively protesting like were back in 1760 during the start of the industrial revolution.


Healthcare 

An AI doctor is currently learning about (Chatgpt-like software) thats potentially going to make better judgments and diagnosis then the doctors themselves
We still might be a long way down the road from this one, but money is clearly being dumped into projects like these 

Education 

AI softwares will have an ability to recognize students learnings patterns and adapt the learning program to each student individually.
Results have been proven already at staggering 62% grade improvement. 
Not everyone learns the same and thats the problem AI will fix

These are very few of many sectors in which AI will intertwine with our lives and its only the beginning. 

As with all booms in the tech, AI is the logical next step.

For AI to achieve massive adoption it needs computing power, advertisement and ___________?

To break them down

Computing power

If you havent heard about Nvidia, Dell, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing etc.  you must live under a rock
These companies have been under the spotlight for a while now and theyre making record deals and gains.
For example.in 2013 Nvidia sold 1.5mil units of their H100 GPUs to Meta, Microsoft, Google and other companies for 37.5Billion in revenue only from 1 processor(wait times were about 6 months).
Theyre also expecting to ship 2 million of the same GPU in this year.
With currently a supply being shorter then the demand, many companies are on a race to pick up the biggest pie of the cake and that was reflected on their stock prices.
With that being said ,Computing Power was one fragment of AI boom where the money could have been made by us investors( thats if you recognized the opportunity on time) .
Not saying theres no more money to be made in this sector but weve definitely come far, fast. 

The next fragment needed for a massive adoption of AI is advertisement.

Google and Amazon are taking the first spots 
AI is directly used in advertising products across all of the sectors.
Its abilities are reducing the amount of manpower for the job and its is also self advertising by doing so.
These kind of automated tasks will give companies the ability to reduce labour cost which will directly translate into higher revenue.
Massive adoption of AI in advertisement sector is coming sooner then you think. 

For a seed to become a tree it will need water, sunlight,and carbon dioxide.
As we mentioned above, massive AI adoption will need Computing Power, Advertisement and something else to really take over the whole technological sector like a wildfire.
The reason why I believe it needs something else to spark is because its simply not there yet.

Theres been great opportunities to make money in the last year with crypto going parabolic, especially AI projects, plain company stocks that sell/manufacture semi conductors, playing call options on their earnings, holding or playing call options on microstrategy etc.

With all the above being said, Im asking you redditors, what is the missing link? 
If we could figure out where will the next big money flow into, we can be ahead of the game and make some serious money.

CrowdStrike fell $28.98 to $228.83 as of early afternoon trading. The company has now lost one-third of its value since July 19, when a historic outage of Microsoft systems, caused by a software update from CrowdStrike, knocked numerous industries offline, including airlines.

Late Monday, CNBCs Phil Lebeau reported that Delta hired Boies, chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner, to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft. No suit has been filed, Lebeau reported, and Delta didnt respond to a request for comment.

Delta is handling over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests after almost 7,000 flights were canceled. The outages cost the airline an estimated $350 million to $500 million. 

The Department of Transportation said last week that its investigating Delta due to the widespread flight disruptions and service failures.

Boies is known for representing the U.S. government in its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft and for helping win a decision that overturned Californias ban on gay marriage. He also worked with Harvey Weinstein, the imprisoned former Hollywood mogul, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who is currently serving a prison sentence for defrauding investors.

2024-07-30,1722371244.0,AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators  chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the worlds most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidias nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMDs quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.

2024-07-31,1722456843.0,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Heres how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the companys forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomms biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for AI smartphones, such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Metas Quest headsets in a business it calls Internet of Things. The line also includes revenues from the companys new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.

CEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a milestone in Qualcomms efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.

Those three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the companys chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.

Qualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.

Qualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.

Dollar General is going to flush tomorrow and all of Q1.

Their earnings call was a joke today. Company is in the trash. Just take a look at any possible sub reddits of maybe people who work there and it's basically a dumpster fire. Turnover must be nuts.

The CEO was explaining how they are trying to suck less in football yards today as an analogy. Hilarious.

Aside from the stores being dirty and disorganized, here is some main points I would like to bring to your attention.

-They are working to open more locations when their competition is closing 1000 stores. I think the market has had enough of the dollar store. People are going to Walmart and using affirm if they are poor. More stores = more operating costs.

-They want to provide fresh produce at stores. Are they really gonna wanna piss money away on this when they want to control the heat at every store and the toilets are already plugged? Lots of spending for probably no reward in my opinion. If a fridge breaks, it ain't cheap to repair. Allegedly port o pottys outside some stores. I rest my case.

-They are already having less SKUS which means less product = most likely less product with markups.

-Getting rid of self check-out with a person to hire at the front. More renovations will cost them more money.

-High theft from staff and customers.

-High staff turnover isn't cheap.

-Logistics is bad, and with more stores it's probably not gonna get better. Bad logistics=shitty produce.

Passive investment products have long been pulling in the lions share of money from investors, but as 2023 came to a close they achieved a milestone: holding more assets than their actively managed counterparts.

The total assets under management in exchange-traded funds and notes along with passively managed mutual funds reached a combined $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging above the $13.23 trillion held in active assets, according to Morningstar.

While passively managed stock funds long ago took the lead, this was the first time that passively managed products surpassed active across all asset classes combined.

Its been a long time coming, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and one of Wall Streets closest trackers of the ETF industry since it first started drawing investor attention. Last year with equities it was a very difficult year for active outperformance. ...

In a statement, the two companies said ""there is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.""

Adobe shares rose around 1.8% on the news in pre-market trading Monday.

""Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently,"" Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe, wrote in a statement. ""While Adobe and Figma shared a vision to jointly redefine the future of creativity and productivity, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on our massive market opportunity and mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences.""

Adobe will pay Figma a $1 billion breakup fee, Adobe said in a regulatory filing.

The news is a sudden pivot from Narayen's latest talking points, as he told CNBC Wednesday that the company believes in the acquisition and its benefits for consumers.

""We want to take the ability for what Figma has done with respect to creative collaborative software on the web, combine that with what Adobe has done in our creative, and make it even more accessible for others,"" Narayen told CNBC's Jim Cramer. ""We think it's an adjacency, we really believe in our merits of the case, but the regulatory environment is challenging.""

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

2024-08-28,1724805443.0,"The next tech giant. Why $HOOD, $PLTR and $DKNG are the investment opportunities of a lifetime. (Part 1)","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.

$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.

$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.

And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.

There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.

From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :

Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.

Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.

Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.

Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.

Costco's growth is powered by its expanding membership and strategic global presence. Their operational efficiency and stable financial performance position them well for the future.

2024-08-27,1724769370.0,Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters,"* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.
* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. 
* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. 
* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.
* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**

Tldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra.

I know everyone is going to say Im wrong but Ive correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.   Many of them years before it happens.

2024-08-25,1724616788.0,"You, too, can easily predict Boeing crashes! (A serious and in depth discussion on Boeing, ULA, NASA, and the future of spaceflight)","Good day fellow regards,

First of all, y'all are wild! A lazy Saturday morning tongue-in-cheek shitpost about Boeing and the NASA press conference has a lot of you wearing tin foil hats, but man Stevie Wonder saw this coming on Thursday. No, theres no insider trading or outing my dad, or any other wacky ideas you have. Here, I'll walk you through it:

2014 - NASA announces the  
ISS CCP contract, awarding both Boeing ($4.2 bil) and SpaceX ($2.6 bil) getting  
the actual final contracts, with first flights targeted for 2017. Space-X  
develops the Dragon, launches on the Falcon 9, massive success, yada yada, you  
know the story. Boeing meanwhile buys Atlas V rockets (from itself at ULA) to  
fly their Starliner, which we'll get back to in a bit.

Starliner's unmanned OFT1 test flight came 2 years late in 2019 and was an absolute shitshow start to finish. So bad, in fact, that NASA required a second unmanned OFT2 test flight, which Boeing didn't complete until 2022, and was also a total failure (remember that it tried launching in 2021 and couldnt, and a crew abort system test was required afterwards). There was a lot of speculation that an OFT3 was needed,  
but NASA kind of surprised everyone by letting the Astronauts go up on the  
current CFT1 mission this summer, albeit with highly experienced NASA  
astronauts on board, and not Boeings crew (for reasons that are highly  
apparent now). 

The ISS is a menagerie of disparate modules strapped together with next to no standardization. Theres an excellent USA Today article that came out a couple of weeks ago: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/nasa-starliner-astronauts-iss/74590421007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/nasa-starliner-astronauts-iss/74590421007/) That means that until the Starliner is jettisoned, nobody else was coming up. The writing was on the wall on 8/16 when Boeing quietly announced that it was in talks to sell ULA to Sierra [https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/)

Thursday NASA announced it was holding the final decision press conference on Saturday at 1 PM ET - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/leadership-to-discuss-nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/leadership-to-discuss-nasas-boeing-crew-flight-test/) This is where even Stevie Wonder saw the final decision. Ask yourself if youve ever known a government worker to come in on a Saturday? And why would NASA hold that conference at that date and time unless it was bad news for their publicly-traded contractor? You should have all been calling your nanas puts or whatever the heck it is you do (Im only here for the memes and spaceflight chatter, I dunno why you like space company stocks, but thats how I got here)

And seriously, this decision has been predicted for weeks by the likes of NASASpaceflightNow and Ars Technica (who have amazing Rocket Reports, highly recommended - [https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/rocket-report-a-ula-sale-tidbit-polaris-dawn-mission-is-on-deck/](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/rocket-report-a-ula-sale-tidbit-polaris-dawn-mission-is-on-deck/) )

That brings us to the actual announcement of SpaceX to the rescue (in the words of Billie Eilish, duh) - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/) The more telling piece in this announcement, is that there will be a 3-week lag time between Starliner undocking and the SpaceX Crew 9 launch. History students of NASA will recognize that as an abnormally large amount of time to leave the ISS manned with a single lifeboat (Crew 8), especially one that does not exactly have the space (or space suits) for all the astronauts onboard. The fact that NASA thinks its less risky to keep so many people on the ISS without adequate lifeboat coverage for such duration is frankly pretty huge. Lets talk about what that means.

First, why did NASA not require the 3^(rd) unmanned test with so many issues on the 2 OFTs? Well, remember the Atlas V thing? ULA builds the Atlas V and announced in 2021 that it was getting retired, and finished the last production rockets earlier this year. All 15 Atlas Vs left have been spoken for, and that includes all of Boeings ISS CCP missions (only 6).

Well, NASA also announced that the ISS is being shut down and de-orbited in 2030 - [https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-selects-international-space-station-us-deorbit-vehicle/) which isnt that far away. NASA has more or less 6 years of needs to service the ISS at this point, and it will absolutely take Boeing at least 2 years to get the next mission ready, which lets face it, will be a test again. (Two of the board members on the safety panel for this mission were on the Columbia panel and were overruled, they are damn well not going to let that happen again).

Well ULA is already contracted with Amazon for some of its Kuiper constellation of satellites, on those aforementioned Atlas Vs. It makes far more financial sense at this point for Boeing to wash its hands of the Starliner (which is a cost-plus contract $1.4 bil over budget so far) and sell those remaining 6 ULA Atlas Vs to Amazon and/or other highest bidders, and use those pumped numbers to help sell off ULA (or at least for Boeing to exit and leave ULA entirely in Lockheeds hands, which isnt a bad play for either of them). Boeing leaving is so much more than Starliner, as they are the contractor for the Space Launch System (lol wsb won't me use it's real acronym cause it's a stock) Block 2 EUS ($2.4 bil already and they havent even built one), and even bigger yet, they are the contractor for the Space Launch System Block 1 Core Stages, which frankly is a deep dive all on its own. Suffice it to say, Boeing has received at least $10 bil for the 1^(st) of the 6 of these it needs to supply, and then after that the Block 2 Core Stage will be a Boeing/Grumman concern (of which Grumman can easily handle on its own).

Boeing has its fingers in a lot of the future NASA missions, but almost all of them involve much more highly experienced partners that can take over, and the two sole Boeing products (Starliner and Block 1 Cores) can be respectively canceled, and paired back (we dont even have enough RS-25 engines to build the last 2 Cores, and only 2-4 are in production right now, it would be super easy to stop at 4)

So, stonks then. This mission has been a \*very\* public demonstration of technical ineptitude that has captured the attention of the American media and public. To paraphrase, 2 deaths is a tragedy, 346 deaths is statistics. To the general public, a couple of crashes overseas by airlines they never heard of isnt going to move the needle like 2 certified American heroes being stranded in space, and yes, stranded is the right word. I have no idea what the BA stock will do (nor do I care, my position is 0 and always been, same with dear old dad), thats for you apes to prognosticate.

I predict (based on the very publicly available insider information that is government contracts and NASA press releases), that NASA and Boeing will announce a cancellation of Starliner (and likely blame it on the short amount of time ISS has left and lack of need for the 6, nay 5, service missions), followed by more news on Boeing pulling the plug on all of its NASA commitments one joint venture at a time. Does that make Lockheed, Grumman, Sierra, and Blue Origin look more attractive for investment? And will Boeing crash because of filthy normals calling their brokers to sell, or will it go up based on selling off all their unprofitable spaceflight work to concentrate on building convertible airplanes? I dunno, you tell me down below.

Nvidia is cooking the books and inflate the demand to increase their chip prices...

  
Wait a minute, there is another strange thing in the tables above. In the latest results, #NVIDIA declares:

* 18.8bn$ of future inventory commitments
* 10.6bn$ of future non-inventory commitments
* TOTAL 29.4bn$

This means that #NVIDIA increased the orders with its suppliers to produce GPUs only by 16.7% while total future commitments increased by 42%. What about inventory orders compared to one year ago? They grew from 7.24bn$ to 18.8bn$ or TWO-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE PERCENT

Wait a minute, by how much did #NVIDIAs Computer and Networking revenues grow over the past year? 404%&

Basically, #NVIDIA pretends us to believe that:

* Its clients purchase in big sizes never asking for a discount (and do not forget \~50% of the total revenues come from just 4 names: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta)
* Its suppliers continue producing at the same costs over the years despite the boom in order

So clearly the laws of demand and supply do not apply to #NVIDIA unless& the company keeps rebates to clients and production costs increases by its suppliers off-the-book to keep showcasing unrealistic margins in the same way they did, and got fined for, in the aftermath of the dotcom bust: [NVIDIA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/is-nvda-currently-employing-the-same-accounting-trick-to-inflate-its-margins-it-was-previously-caught-using-during-the-dot-com-bubble/)

As if the above I described was not already enough, we already know:

* NVIDIA is inflating its sales via client financing. In some very peculiar situations, Nvidia is even a significant shareholder of them, like in the case of Coreweave: [NVIDIA (PONZI) LIES UNDER NVIDIA NOSE](https://justdario.com/2023/11/nvda-ponzi-lies-under-nvda-nose/)
* NVIDIA is gamma-squeezing its own stock: [NVIDIA  THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/nvidia-the-fraud-smoking-gun/)

At this point, I believe there is no more doubt that #NVIDIA is only one piece of a bigger fraudulent puzzle.

1- #NVIDIA invests in [#Coreweave](https://justdario.com/tag/coreweave/)

2- #Coreweave buys (overpriced) #NVIDIA GPUs.

3- #Coreweave raises financing using #NVIDIA GPUs as collateral. What do they do with that? They buy more #NVIDIA GPUs, of course&

4- Meanwhile #Microsoft signs a deal with #Coreweave worth billions for future use of a cloud infrastructure #Coreweave didnt even begin to build yet while #Microsoft is, at the same time, loading on #NVIDIA GPUs for Azure that technically is a #Coreweave competitor?!

**Growth**  
Nintendo 3 years average growth is 7%, and EPS growth is 20%. The revenue growth is lower compared with its peers, like Play Station and Xbox. The EPS growth is good, but not outstanding, lower than game developers Capcom, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix. Koei Tecmo and Capcom have delivered impressive growth in the last three years. Play Station and Take-Two achieved high revenue growth but did not drive their profit increase.  
From the growth data comparison, I think Nintendo needs new drivers for the next generation. It plans to increase capital investment in IP expansion and initiate more people access to its dedicated game platform, but I think it not be the main driver in the next competition.  
**Profit**  
Nintendo has good profit margins with a gross margin of 55% and an operating margin of 32%. This is higher than most competitors. Koei Tecmo and Capcom are more attractive, but they don't have a platform. Compared with Sony Play Station and Sega, Nintendo's performance is better. I can't find the margin data of the Gaming business from Microsoft's financial report, so I use the personal segment data, maybe this is not exact.  
Although Nintendo has a decline in cash turnover compared with its history, Nintendo did much better than its competitors. Considering its good margins, I think Nintendo has strong profitability and return.  
**Returns**  
Nintendo has an outstanding investment return of 46% and an equity return of 21% compared with its competitors, especially in investment return. I think this benefited from a great composite of solid margins and a high cash turnover rate.  
Again, I use the company's whole business ROE of Microsoft as I can't get the gaming sector number to calculate it. Considering Microsoft's main business is office software and cloud, this ROE number may not be comparable.

2024-01-11,1704980118.0,Ubisoft(UBI) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADIVCE*** 

# Introduction:

Ubisoft has been the fortunate party to be on the benefiting end of the Microsoft-Activision merger. Essentially receiving the catalog of ATVI's IPs including new releases up till 2038 to add on to their subscription service Ubisoft+. However, complaints of the lack of originality of new releases from UBI, delayed/canceled releases of games, and a subscription service that is priced too high for the value it provides are all issues that UBI faces. It seems that new releases are re-modeled replicas of the previous release. Ubisoft is starting to become less like a video game developer and more like a video game factory assembly line.

# Revenue:

Overall, for forecasting revenue I took into account that UBI has many of their highly anticipated mobile titles such as Rainbow Six Siege Mobile and Tom Clancy The Division being released in 2024, this is a strong step into the large mobile market for UBI. I ran 3 possible scenarios 1) UBI continues growing their player base Y/Y 2) UBI hemorrhages players somewhere in my forecast, and the ones that stick around are the players that are subscribed to Ubisoft+ 3) Market Scenario, the scenario that the market expects.

***SCENARIO 1***

\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/MSvHt3W)\]

For scenario 1, I assumed that the player count would continuously grow.   
When forecasting the number of active players, I assumed there would be a spike in player count for the first half of my forecast before tapering off as UBI acquires a significant portion of their most eager customers.  
When forecasting Revenue/Active Players, I believe that a significant portion of active players will come from the purchase of Ubisoft+. So I assumed that the revenue/active players would experience significant growth in the first half of my forecast before tapering off as customers purchasing Ubisoft+ may just be trying it out or may end up not like the Ubisoft+ service.

Ubisoft would be priced at $202.75 per share for Scenario 1.",stocks,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1941upw/ubisoftubi_dcf_analysis/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9987123012542725
2024-01-13,1705179848.0,"66% down on alibaba in a rather big position, thoughts?","please don't judge me, don't joke about it and only respond if you're serious.

Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)

around 60k in alibaba, at 185¬

Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.

So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66¬, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.

I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120¬ / 180¬, who knows.

2024-08-25,1724607819.0,"The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings","## Why is AI a bubble?

Before any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.

The business case for AI is dead simple: ""Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?"". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like ""just make it work"" and ""do more with less"". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 ""just make it work"" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.

It's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying ""FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green"" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.

And GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.

## Why now?

A ground rule for machine learning is ""exponential investment for linear gains"". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.

* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of ""all words ever written by humans"".
* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).
* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).
* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.

But most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of ""the next version will finally be it, trust me bro"" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.

## Why Nvidia?

Nvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.

The expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.

Nvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.

## Are we in for a broader tech crash?

Personally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.

The real hit in the medium term will be to ""shovel sellers"". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.

It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new.

* Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy).
* Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020.
* GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - ""Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use."".

Looking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol.

All these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this?

I looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding.

But this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives? I am really confused about what happened. So please ELI5.

Edit - I will summarize what people are saying in comments and share this tweet someone commented- [https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603](https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603)

Most important part is about scaling laws and emergent properties. Essentially - AI is showing unexpectedly ""intelligent"" properties at higher compute powers (emergent properties) and these companies now believe that this will scale at even higher compute powers. No one know what will happen. It might happen that the emergent properties was a one time thing and AI may never get more intelligent or it will continue and we get a ""Digital God"" (according to the tweet).

So something did change in last couple of years, and the reason no one invested before was because no one saw it coming and it was an emergent property.",stocks,252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fbk12b/can_someone_explain_why_ai_is_getting_so_much/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9875866174697876

2024-09-09,1725902300.0,Why ElasticSearch (ESTC) is still overvalued after a 30% drop this month,"I wanted to bring some qualitative discussion as to why I think Elasticsearch is only at the start of its downfall.

You'll need to know some history behind how Elasticsearch started and why it became so popular in the DevOps world. 

TLDR: They used to be opensource but Amazon basically stole their code and offered their service on AWS with the same name. Elasticsearch got pissed, changed their licensing from open source in 2021 and sued Amazon. Fast forward to today, theyve now settled with Amazon. However, since 2021, AWS has created their own competitor called Opensearch which is basically just a forked version of Elasticsearch with Amazons own contribution to it.... and they've been gaining a ton of market share.

The main reasons why

1. Engineering managers and open source devs that spent time on developing Elasticsearch open source got screwed by Elastic in 2021 and trust eroded

2. Opensearch is a part of the AWS ecosystem and why would a company go out of their way to add another vendor like Elastic if everythings already managed under AWS for them?

This graph shows a snapshot of the adoption of both:  
https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BOpenSearch%3BSplunk?

As you can see Opensearch is gaining more and more traction where as Elastic seems to be stagnating.

However, anecdotally, I think this is worse than it looks for Elasticsearch. I know for a fact internally teams still refer to Opensearch as Elasticsearch because it is just a fork of it.

  
I think this story will be similar to how Microsoft Teams due to its distribution channels completely swept up market share from Zoom. Similarly, I think this will happen with Opensearch and Elasticsearch.",stocks,33.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fcuvg6/why_elasticsearch_estc_is_still_overvalued_after/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9984808564186096
2024-03-02,1709406942.0,BBAI - Thoughts?,"I have been following Big Bear for about a year and a half now. I remember when they almost got delisted last December for being under a dollar, and I held some long term calls. They exploded in February, and have been staying above that dollar threshold for the year. They pop every few months it feels when new news about a government contract comes out.

Personally, Ive watched them slowly buy other AI companies, change their leadership structure, still compete in AI competitions, and it seems for an AI company thats relatively new they are building a foundation. Theyve secured a few government contracts, and seem to be doing alright. They have a 759M market cap, they continue to grow, and overall they seem alright.

Ive seen they have contracts with Amazon too? I dont know how accurate that is. Honestly, for a stock Ive sunk some money into, I havent researched the metrics of it. I like the model, I see the foundation, Im in. I see AI as the future, so Im just going to double down with what I have. Its my YOLO stock. Its made me some gains, so why not invest a little bit in it. 

The way I see it, your not going to show massive earnings when youre acquiring other companies. Thats what youre spending your money on. Their debt to equity ratio seems to have leveled out though, so in my eyes it seems that they are about to surge forward. 

Basically I see lots of people commenting about it now, personally, Ive had my calls pay for my shares, so what Im in it now Im not taking out.

2024-09-12,1726103727.0,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. Its been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the companys cloud businesses. The stock didnt have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

The excitement is back, Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting momentum across all business.

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia  up 136%  among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracles rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth  18% in fiscal 2023  and four times the company has contracted.

After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits, JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the companys cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsofts headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company hed competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come, Ellison said on Mondays earnings call.

Oracle didnt immediately provide a comment for this story.

# No more passwords

For years, Ellison described Oracles database as autonomous, playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Teslas board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldnt need manual patching and wouldnt have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late hes benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazons market-leading cloud with Oracles full-featured database.

Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time, AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, hes now taking on passwords, which he calls utterly ridiculous because theyre insecure and can be easily hacked.

This is the way log-on is going to work, Ellison said on the earnings call. Im going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, OK, Hi Larry. Were done.

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so theres no reason his computer shouldnt be able to the same.

No more passwords, he said. Those have got to go.

2024-09-16,1726517905.0,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsingers effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to evaluate independent sources of funding, and comes days after Intels board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone operating board and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand, Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intels quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidias general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the companys 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMCs forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMCs 3nm process are shipping now in Apples iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio thats currently under construction.

All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because thats the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know were capable of achieving, Gelsinger said.

IonQ recognized revenue of $6.1 million for the quarter and $22.0 million for the full year, putting results at the high end and above the high end of the respective financial outlook range. This represents 98% annual growth compared to $11.1 million in the prior year.
IonQ achieved $6.7 million in new bookings for the fourth quarter and $65.1 million for the full year, above the high end of the full year financial outlook range. This represents 166% annual growth compared to $24.5 million in the prior year.
Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $455.9 million as of December 31, 2023.
Net loss was $41.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA loss was $20.0 million for the fourth quarter. As for the full year 2023, net loss was $157.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA loss was $77.7 million, ahead of IonQs full year Adjusted EBITDA financial outlook.* Exclusions from Adjusted EBITDA include a non-cash gain in the fourth quarter of $7.6 million and a full year 2023 loss of $19.2 million related to the change in the fair value of IonQs warrant liabilities.
*Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined under Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and is reconciled to net loss, its closest comparable GAAP measure, at the end of this release.
Corporate Highlights
IonQ today announced the appointment of Robert Cardillo, former Director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to its Board of Directors. In this role, Cardillo will seek to expand upon IonQs work with the U.S. government in establishing public-private partnerships that position the U.S. as a global leader in the quantum economy.
IonQ today announced the appointment of Bill Scannell, President of Global Sales and Customer Operations at Dell Technologies, to its Board of Directors. As a member of the Board of Directors, Scannell will provide input and direction for IonQs system sales strategy and help strengthen the companys leadership position in the quantum economy.
Technical Highlights
IonQ achieved its 2024 technical milestone of #AQ 35 on IonQ Forte in December 2023, a full year ahead of schedule. At #AQ 35, IonQ expects its systems may be more commercially practical than the worlds most powerful quantum simulators for certain applications. These systems will now be more useful than ever for tackling quantum applications, such as those in quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry.
IonQ today announced that it has furthered its performance leadership by achieving #AQ 36 in January 2024, also on IonQ Forte. Achieving #AQ 36 roughly doubles the computational space that Forte can now consider, relative to its performance at #AQ 35.
IonQ announced that it had achieved its first major milestone in implementing photonic interconnects, the core technology that will allow IonQ to scale compute and networking between multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). IonQ can now generate photons entangled with ions repeatedly and reproducibly, creating a quantum state which will allow future quantum systems to communicate and transfer information between each other.
IonQ today announced that it has demonstrated its forthcoming photonic integrated circuit, or PIC, technology in a lab setting. This technology will allow for the light that controls qubits to be routed directly to QPUs, enabling superior performance and form factors for future generations of IonQ quantum computers.
Commercial Highlights
IonQ announced the start of construction on its first production-class IonQ Forte Enterprise systems in its Seattle manufacturing facility, with plans to begin delivery to customers by the end of 2024. These #AQ 35 systems will feature modular rack-mounted form factors designed to fit seamlessly into customers data centers.
IonQ announced the availability of IonQ Forte through Amazon Braket Direct, a fully managed, white glove quantum computing service from Amazon Web Services. Customers can use Braket Direct to reserve dedicated capacity on different quantum devices and connect with quantum computing experts for hands-on support.
IonQ announced a predictive maintenance project with Thompson Machinery, a Caterpillar dealer serving parts of Tennessee and Mississippi, to deploy a quantum machine learning model tasked with detecting potential failures in equipment and compare it directly to a classical model. The quantum model was more likely to detect failures, did so with more precision, and shows promise of being economically significant.
Earlier this month, IonQ was joined by U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell from the State of Washington to inaugurate the Companys new Seattle production facility with a ribbon cutting ceremony. Responding to an uptick in customer demand, IonQ has already decided to increase the footprint of this facility by 50%.
2024 Financial Outlook
For the full year 2024, IonQ expects revenue to be between $37.0 million and $41.0 million, with between $6.5 million and $7.5 million for the first quarter.
IonQ anticipates full year 2024 bookings of between $70 million and $90 million.
IonQ anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA** loss of $110.5 million for the full year 2024 at the midpoint of the revenue outlook provided above.
** Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Company cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net loss without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of estimates for stock-based compensation and change in fair value of assumed warrant liabilities, as these items are not within the Companys control, may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.
Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call
IonQ will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time to review the Companys financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and to provide a business update. The call will be accessible by telephone at 877-407-4018 (domestic) or 201-689-8471 (international). The call will also be available live via webcast on the Companys website here, or directly here. A telephone replay of the conference call will be available approximately three hours after its conclusion at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international) with access code 13743612 and will be available until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time, March 13, 2024.

Intel is going all-in on boosting artificial-intelligence performance across its computer processor lineup.  
  
On Thursday, the semiconductor company launched a new lineup of laptop processors named Core Ultra, which are designed to enhance AI-related features in PC software applications.

The launch of Intel Core Ultra represents the unmatched scale and speed at which Intel is enabling AI on the PC, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intels general manager of Client Computing Group said in a news release. Intel is best-positioned to deliver this next generation of computing.  
  
The executive predicts AI PCs, which have capabilities to accelerate AI workloads, will account for 80% of the PC market over the next four years. The chip maker also said more than 100 software vendors have optimized their applications with AI-related features that take advantage of Core Ultra.

Starting Thursday, computers with the Core Ultra chips are available worldwide from leading PC makers, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft and Samsung   


Intel also launched its latest server processorsthe fifth-generation Intel Xeon chips.

2024-01-25,1706165885.0,Why Im Buying Rivian Stock,"Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. Im not very smart and I hate wearing suits. Im a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And thats what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1  Big Picture - EVs Will Win& Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Governments will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.
3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. Weve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we aint gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.

I know Im painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go&  
  
Now, just because EVs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesnt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEMs like Ford, GM",stocks,631.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19f3fgb/why_im_buying_rivian_stock/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.7011290192604065

* Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia said on Wednesday they had partnered up to offer the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients.

* The service will make it easier for companies to own artificial intelligence computing systems and have better control over their data, instead of renting out Nvidia's market-leading chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon.com or Microsoft.

* Many large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and requiring liquid cooling.

* Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.

* ""We want to drive privacy because what we're hearing at large customers is they are very worried about controlling their own destiny,"" Jon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, told Reuters in an interview.

* However, ""being able to then figure out how to operate (AI data centers) efficiently and effectively - this is an entirely new set of capabilities that is not generally available.""

* Nvidia and Equinix said the new offering is available as of Wednesday but did not disclose any immediate customers.

Will this have a big impact on the companies involved? Is there a real fear of Amazon losing customers?

2024-02-01,1706822626.0,"Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, or close to 2% of its workforce","Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, CNBC confirmed on Thursday, the latest tech company to slash headcount this year as investors continue to push for efficiency.

A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the companys workforce.

We regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy, the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. As part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.

Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.

The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.

As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.

Last month, Microsoft
 cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google
 said its eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon
 laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.

In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta
 announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that its laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.

Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zooms stock has stumbled.

Zoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.

Last February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the uncertainty of the global economy, CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.

2024-02-06,1707254213.0,"Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates headwind","Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.

Heres how the company did:

Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.

Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.

Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.


Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.

For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamass attack on Israel.

While we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4, Snap said in a letter to investors.

Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.

Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.

Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration. In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.

Snaps net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.

Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an internal forecast for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of the unpredictable nature of war, referring to the Israel-Hamas war.

Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.

Snaps growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.

Snap and Pinterest are much smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. In this environment, the big are getting bigger,

Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.

2024-02-08,1707426697.0,Pinterest shares crater 25% on weak revenue and forecast,"Pinterest shares plummeted 25% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a weaker-than-expected forecast and missed on revenue.

Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.


Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.

Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.

Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.

Pinterests report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta
, Alphabet
 and Amazon
 all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.

But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.

Prior to Thursdays report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.

Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.

2024-05-07,1715115718.0,Reddit shares soar 14% after company reports revenue pop in first earnings report,"Reddit shares rallied 14% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company released quarterly results for the first time since its IPO in March.

Heres how the company did:

Loss per share: $8.19 loss per share. That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG

Revenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG

Revenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.

Digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Metas ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.

Reddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.

For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.

Reddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the companys CEO. 

We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit, Huffman said in a release Tuesday.

Reddit began trading under the ticker symbol RDDT on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddits private market valuation reached $10 billion.

The stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.

The company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.

2024-06-25,1719346503.0,Rivian shares soar 30% after Volkswagen takes $1 billion stake ,"Volkswagen is taking a $1 billion stake in electric vehicle startup Rivian, which has been seeking to cut costs and shore up cash amid slower-than-expected adoption of EVs.

The companies announced the deal after markets closed Tuesday  two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses.

Volkswagen is now the second legacy automaker to take a stake in the California-based company. Ford Motor was among Rivians largest stakeholders, at roughly 12%, alongside Amazon when Rivian went public in 2021. The Detroit automaker sold a majority of its Rivian shares by 2023 after walking back a plan to codevelop EVs with the company.

Rivian reported a loss of $1.45 billion during the first quarter of this year, as it retooled its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV EVs ahead of its next-generation vehicles in 2026.

The company has been on a cost-cutting mission for months. It has trimmed staff, retooled its Illinois plant to increase efficiencies and paused construction of a new multibillion-dollar factory in Georgia. That last measure is expected to save more than $2.25 billion in capital spending, including the impact of starting production of Rivians next-generation R2 vehicle at its plant in Illinois.

Rivian reported $7.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to end March, with more than $9 billion in total liquidity.

2024-06-24,1719252930.0,DD for Affirm $AFRM: bullish on e-commerce partnerships ,"**Affirm is operating in an Oligopoly**

The current competitive environment for BNPL providers can be described as an oligopoly. In terms of worldwide GMV, Klarna reigns supreme (although their US GMV is comparable to the other two), and Affirm is roughly on par with Afterpay.

 **Current market share by GMV**

Klarna: 62%
Afterpay: 19%
Affirm: 17%



Other BNPL providers such as Sezzle and Zip exist, but have been sidelined due to their lack of scale and would reach low single-digits in market share at most.

While Affirm is currently in third place, the partnerships forged by the company with Shopify and Amazon are starting to pay off. In each of the past 5 quarters, Affirm has grown GMV (and revenue) significantly faster than its competitors, pulling away more strongly each quarter.

*GMV growth rate in Q1 2024:**

Affirm: 37%
Afterpay: 25%
Klarna: 18%


The e-commerce market in the USA is dominated by two competitors (yet another Oligopoly): Amazon and Shopify. Affirm has tie-ups with both of these, and is the default BNPL provider in the USA on the two websites. Partnerships like these are starting to drive incremental growth to Affirm  they dont have to spend a ton of money to acquire new customers, as anyone shopping on Shopify or Amazon will inevitably encounter them.

**Apple Pay partnerships confirms their dominance with large merchants*

They recently signed an agreement to become the default BNPL provider for Apple Pay. This is significant for three reasons:

1.      Incremental growth due to Apples size

Mizuho estimated that Apple Pay represents approximately USD 265 billion in US payment volumes, of which Affirm might capture USD 12 billion in GMV. At their current ratios, this would mean approximately USD 1 billion in incremental revenue for Affirm.

2.      Confirmation of Affirms track record

Even more importantly, it is yet another sign of a huge, customer-obsessed company signing with Affirm. These companies are placing a lot of trust in the fact that Affirm can provide a smooth customer experience, and it seems they have not let anyone down so far.

3.      Makes competition less likely

Affirm stock took a hit about a year ago when Apple first announced they would get into the BNPL business. Their fast withdrawal now signals not only that Affirm is a reliable provider for large companies, but also that the business has significant barriers to entry that even a huge company like Apple was not willing to attack.

Now that Affirm is offered at Amazon and Shopify, it is quite unlikely for these companies to adopt a second default BNPL option. In fact, Affirm had an exclusivity arrangement with Amazon that expired in January 2023, but the company has yet to add another BNPL provider. Why should they? As long as Affirm is able to fulfill all requests by customers who ask for BNPL, there is no need to complicate things with an additional provider.

**Conclusion**

Affirm is a bit of a controversial stock with varying price targets. Based on their financial track record and management, I am confident that they have set the right levers for continued growth in the coming years. On a 5-10 year timescale, I am very confident that Affirm will significantly outperform the overall e-commerce growth, as well as all its BNPL competitors.

2024-05-15,1715781488.0,Crocs Inc (CROX) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

CROX was introduced in the early 2000s, It was an instant hit with consumers despite CROX's unconventional designs. However, the company got too greedy and started introducing multiple products that diluted the core branding of CROX coupled with the financial crisis of 2008 led to the stagnation of CROX in the early 2010s. However, CROX had a huge boost in popularity during COVID-19, as people stayed home and prioritized comfort, purchasing a lot of athleisure products including Crocs. CROX learned from its past failures and capitalized on its resurgence through limited edition releases and collaboration with famous artists, this combined effort allowed CROX to reach nearly 4 billion in revenue in FY23.



# Market:

According to the 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference, management sees strong growth potential for China, the UK, South Korea, and Australia. There are also a few large but challenging markets such as Japan and India.

In Korea, CROXs products are popular, especially clogs due to the current fashion trend Y2K. Y2K is a fashion trend that celebrates the fashion trends of the early 2000s and that coincidentally happens to be the era where clogs were popular.

In Japan, CROXs products are popular due to Japans strict culture around the removal of footwear in certain places e.g. Onsen, Restaurants, and Temples. This emphasis on the removal of footwear makes CROX the ideal product for Japanese consumers as CROXs are easy to slip in and out.

India is a market with a large potential for CROX, this is due to the warm weather in India which leads consumers to prefer wearing sandals over covered shoes. However, the largest issue with CROX is that it is too expensive for the Indian consumer. A Clog costs about 3000 Rupees but the average median household income in India is 22,000 Rupees. This large price tag on CROXs products limits the number of consumers who can afford CROXs products.

Birkenstock is CROXs closest competitor, creating shoes that are designed for comfort. However, Birkenstock is pivoting to becoming a luxury brand at a higher price point compared to CROX and is much less personalized to maintain its luxury look. Birkenstock is committed to maintaining its brand image as a luxury brand, even going so far as to leave Amazon. This brand image was further solidified as Birkenstock was acquired by LVMH in 2021. However, this is good for CROX as it has a significantly larger total addressable market compared to Birkenstock.



# Revenue:

***Shoes Sold***

When forecasting the total number of Crocs sold, I assumed that CROXs growth rate will grow at an elevated level for the next 5 years as CROX expands its presence into the new markets coupled with the rise of jibbitz, CROX's products that allow for personalization. The growth rate tapers back down.

When forecasting %DTC, Crocs is taking a leaf out of Nike and Adidas books by reducing their reliance on wholesalers ([SOURCE](https://shop-eat-surf.com/2021/04/crocs-following-in-nikes-footsteps-with-wholesale-cuts/)). Even their closest competitor Birkenstock is pivoting towards DTC. I assumed that %DTC would grow to 60%.



***Crocs Physical Revenue***

When forecasting the number of company-operated Crocs stores, I assumed that the growth rate would pick up 3 years into my forecast as the interest rates environment improves which allows for CROX to expand its physical presence easily before the growth rate tapers back down.

When forecasting Revenue/Store, opting for less granularity I forecasted growth rate as a % of historic averages tapering towards the perpetual inflation rate.



***Crocs Digital Revenue***

When forecasting the %DTC Digital sales, opting for less granularity I assumed it remained constant as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting Price/Shoe, opting for less granularity I forecasted growth rate as a % of historic averages tapering towards the perpetual inflation rate.



***Crocs Wholesale Revenue***

When forecasting the price/shoe, I assumed that over time as CROX becomes more independent and less reliant on wholesalers they will be able to negotiate for more favorable terms from their wholesale partners. So I assumed that the price/shoe would grow at an elevated rate before tapering back down to the perpetual inflation rate.



***HEYDUDE Revenue***

When forecasting the total number of shoes sold, I assumed that the total number of shoes sold increased to a great extent in the earlier years of my forecast to reflect CROX breaking into newer markets. However, I believe that for HEYDUDE to successfully take off and become a multi-national brand it would take a long time and hence I did not reflect that in my valuation.

When forecasting the price/shoe, I assumed that the price did not grow at a fast rate in the earlier years as CROX has to appeal the HEYDUDE brand to more consumers through a lower price point. In the later years, as CROX gains pricing powers they can increase the price it charges per shoe.



# Cost:

***COGS and Others***

When forecasting COGS and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages.

2024-06-24,1719227111.0,Target taps Shopify to add sellers to its third-party marketplace ,"Target is turning to Shopify to add new and trendier brands to its website.

Starting Monday, the Minneapolis-based discounter said companies that work with Shopify can apply to join Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. Some of Shopifys customers are smaller or up-and-coming brands that use the e-commerce platform to build and operate a website.

Target and Shopify did not disclose financial terms or the length of the deal.

In an interview with CNBC, Target Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said Shopify will help the retailer discover hot items and quickly make them available for Targets online shoppers. She said Target plans to put some popular items discovered through the Shopify deal on store shelves.

Targets marketplace creates a halo and is an accelerant to the total business, she said. Sylvester added that as the company expands its online assortment and adds eye-catching merchandise, customers tend to visit its website more frequently and buy from both marketplace sellers and Targets own brands.

The big-box retailer is trying to get back to sales growth as consumers buy less discretionary merchandise, with the discounter lagging behind grocery competitors like Walmart. Target has posted four consecutive quarters of declining comparable sales, and its overall sales have fallen in three of the past four quarters.

The company has struggled to grow its e-commerce business, too. Targets digital sales grew 1.4% in the first quarter, the first such increase in more than a year.

Company leaders said in May that the retailer is on track to return to sales growth in the second quarter, but thats partially due to its weak performance year over year. For the full year, Target said it expects comparable sales will range from flat to up 2%, with adjusted earnings per share of $8.60 to $9.60. 

Shares of Target have underperformed the broader stock market. As of Fridays close, the companys stock is up about 2% compared with the S",stocks,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dnatlw/target_taps_shopify_to_add_sellers_to_its/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9938153028488159

2024-07-04,1720112938.0,Nvidia to make $12bn from AI chips in China this year despite US controls,"Paywall-removed version for the poors (including myself) below. You know, in case any berrs still had an ounce of hope after the Nancy news.

https://www.ft.com/content/b76ef55b-21cd-498b-ac16-5660908bb8d2

_Nvidia is on course to sell $12bn worth of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite US export controls that have throttled its business in one of the worlds biggest semiconductor markets.
The $3tn Silicon Valley group will over the coming months deliver more than 1mn of its new H20 chips, which are designed to fall outside of US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers, according to analyst forecasts._

_That figure is almost twice as many as Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy._

_Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company to find itself entangled in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the worlds most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._

_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._

_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business  including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products  in the financial year ending in January 2024._

_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidias ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._

_Our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past, Jensen Huang, Nvidias chief executive, said during the companys most recent earnings call in May. And its a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology	.	.	.	However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.
Colette Kress, Nvidias finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment  which includes AI chips  in China in the latest quarter was down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October._

_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidias total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._

_Although Nvidias sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._

_Buyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters, Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to strong China demand._

- That fat $4 billion they yeeted at Anthropic.
- Anthropic's Claude 3.5 is shitting all over OpenAI's stuff right now. Amazon might've backed the right horse here, and nobody's talking about it.
- AWS is already the 800-pound gorilla in cloud. Lots of compute to leverage for AI (nobody's bigger than them).
- Amazon's obviously got a lot of cash to snag top AI talent. 
- The whole AGI race. I wouldn't bet against Amazon pulling some Skynet-level shit out of nowhere. I'm also long the other big tech because of this thesis too, however.

2024-07-08,1720476629.0,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

2024-06-02,1717366188.0,Nvidia announces new AI chips as market competition heats up ,"Nvidia on Sunday unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence chips to succeed the previous model, which was announced just months earlier in March.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new AI chip architecture, dubbed Rubin, ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei.

Rubin comes months after the March announcement of the upcoming Blackwell model, which is still in production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024.

Huangs announcement of Rubin appears to quicken the companys already-accelerated pace of AI chip advancement.

Nvidia has pledged to release new AI chip models on a one-year rhythm, as Huang put it on Sunday. The company had previously been operating on a slower two-year update timeline for chips.

The turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin was a matter of less than three months, underscoring the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and Nvidias sprint to preserve its dominant spot.

AMD and Intel are two major competitors working to catch up, though their gross margins trailed Nvidias in the most recent fiscal quarter. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are also vying for Nvidias top spot, even as they are simultaneously some of Nvidias biggest patrons. A flurry of startups are also working to enter the space.

Today, were at the cusp of a major shift in computing, Huang said Sunday. With our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, were pushing the boundaries of whats possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.

The Rubin chip platform will have new GPUs, the crucial graphic processing technology that helps train and launch AI systems. It will come with other new features like a central processor called Vera, though the Sunday announcement did not provide many details.

Shares of Nvidia were relatively flat at Fridays market close with shares trading at $1,096.

*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*

*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*

*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*

*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*

*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*

*According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million. GB200 NVL36 has 36 super chips GB200, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs; GB200 NVL72 has 72 super chips GB200, 36 Grace CPUs, and 72 B200 GPUs.*

*Before the handover of the leadership in June, former TSMC Chairman Liu Deyin predicted that the demand for AI applications is now more optimistic than a year ago. ""This year is another year of great growth."" Current Chairman Wei Zhejia also revealed that AI applications have just begun. , ""I'm as optimistic as everyone else.""*",wallstreetbets,204.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e3k4jh/nvda_raises_tsmc_orders_by_25_gb200_demand/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9947197437286377

**Key Point/ Secret Sauce:**

Were all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, its a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations& \[1\]

More and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \[2\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \[3\], WEF \[4\], Yale \[5\]& etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power. 

SMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (youll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor. 

IMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \~$3b. This cost would later balloon to \~$9b, of which the government would help with about 50%. At worst lets say the first round cost $10b and no government funding. This has always been the largest hurdle to nuclear power plant development, upfront costs.

If an AI company like NVDA decided that they wanted to move from making chips exclusively, to designing/building/implementing entire AI infrastructure hubs (so called AI factories) \[6\] then perhaps they would be interested in upstream M",wallstreetbets,114.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e4q9ji/nuscale_smr_worlds_most_obvious_connection_goes/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9567750096321106

2024-07-03,1720018790.0,ZIM: Let's go again!,"I believe ZIM will soar to at least $40 (x2), maybe more, in the next 4-6 weeks. Heres why:

**Market Situation**

1. **Container Shipping Rates:** Theyve skyrocketed and show no signs of stopping.
2. **Red Sea Drama:** With the Red Sea routes disrupted, ships are taking the scenic route around Africa. This requires 10-12% more ships, absorbing last years new builds and most of the upcoming new fleet.
3. **Container Chaos:** More ships mean more disorganized containers. Shippers hate waiting for empty containers, leaving them at destination ports.
4. **Tariff Tango:** Bidens tariff increases have importers scrambling to ship earlier than the usual August-October peak. Inventories are low after years of adjustments.
5. **Trumps Tariff Tease:** With Trump promising additional tariffs, companies are likely to import more now to avoid future costs. Its like a retail apocalypse, but for shipping!

Rates logically going up

**Zim Shipping**

1. **Big Player:** ZIM is the 10th largest shipping company, mostly leasing boats but owning a few.
2. **Volatile Market:** Shipping is ultra-competitive. When companies make money, they all buy boats, leading to oversupply, like in 2023.
3. **Red Sea Plans:** Like others, ZIM expects Red Sea issues to ease and rates to drop with a large supply of new vessels by year-end.
4. **Managements Gloomy Outlook:** Despite being insiders, ZIMs management didnt foresee the recent rate spikes and forecasted a tough year-end during earnings calls.
5. **Genius Move:** ZIM didnt contract volume for their fleet this year, a rarity. Normally, 70% is contracted to limit volatility, but this year, 65% operates on spot rates, which are currently exploding. They avoided low rates proposed by customers expecting a drop. I don't know if this was thought through but I only care about the result, a genuis move!

2024-07-01,1719798810.0,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by years end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which theyve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they dont settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidias stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didnt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldnt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidias place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasnt happened and Nvidias only gotten stronger.

Thats not to say over time Nvidia wont lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, its not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I dont think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidias growth story.",wallstreetbets,523.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dshht2/nvidia_just_getting_started_stock_heading_to_150/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9885483980178833

2024-02-14,1707945403.0,Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move,"Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.

Its the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.

In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Heres how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected

Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected

Ciscos revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

2024-02-15,1707956054.0,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. Its the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmakers stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Googles $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques  such as transformer architecture  used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a code red situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

Everyone else is doing it. The Fed's  mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Price have stabilized but unemployment is getting weaker even though the stock market is rocketing higher.

The employment picture

-Job openings are declining every month. In March 2022 at peak there were 12,182,000 job openings, in April 2024 there were 8,059,000. That's a 34% decline in 2 years. I'm curious how many of the 8M openings are real jobs, actually looking for a candidate or if the recruiter forgot to take down the opening or if they are trying to keep a pulse on the current conditions without the intent of hiring someone.

The data for the stock market speaks for itself, most of the narrative has been around AI driving the gains, mostly because there isn't anything else exciting going on. Im sure at some point in the next decade we'll start to see all the AI spending show up in the earnings. Im not sure how though when most AI services are FREE. But i think for now we have seen peak earnings, i don't see how a weakening jobs market benefits the stock market earnings. Jobs fuel earnings and consumer spending and good earnings make stock prices go up(most of the time).

Dow Jones Industrial Average- Past Year: +15%

SP 500- Past Year:+24%

NASDAQ100- +30%

I think the Fed will cut rates soon because AI is disrupting the job market making their policy stance more complicated. Its not just about inflation they have a duel mandate. I think that's why Canada cut their rate today and the ECB will cut as well. They can see  whats coming on the horizon and its time to steer the ship left or hit an iceberg.

Good example of what happening in the job market, AI is slowly coming into the workplace, replacing workers with bots. We've also seen consistent layoffs at big tech companies that have coveted high paying roles(Google, META, Microsoft, Amazon). These high paying jobs going away will have tickle down effects in the economy. AI hasn't even been fully deployed yet.

2024-06-05,1717614687.0,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidias milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the companys pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industrys need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidias graphics processing units.

2024-02-26,1708968196.0,"FTC sues to block Kroger, Albertsons merger over price and wage concerns","The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is suing to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, saying the combination of the two major grocers would result in higher prices for shoppers and lower wages for workers.

In a release, the FTC said it issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to stop Krogers $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, which would create one of the largest grocers in the country. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general have joined the court complaint, including those from Arizona, California, Washington D.C., Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming.

Krogers acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today, said Henry Liu, director of the FTCs Bureau of Competition. Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.

Kroger said in a statement that blocking the deal will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: Americas consumers and workers.

 The FTCs decision makes it more likely that Americas consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts, the company said in a statement.

It added that the decision strengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry.

Kroger and Albertsons agreement has been stuck in a holding pattern for more than a year while federal and state regulators scrutinize the merger. The companies announced the proposed deal in October 2022, and said by teaming up, the grocers would be able to better compete with larger retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco.

The FTC argued the supermarket merger would harm shoppers and workers at a time when the price of food and many everyday items has risen. The Biden administration has been skeptical of a range of mergers, and the White House has made consumer protection a key issue as President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection this fall.

Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen has made the companys case for the tie-up, saying as a larger supermarket operator, the combined companies would be able to lower prices, boost profitability and speed up innovation in the grocery industry. The company also pledged $500 million to reduce prices for customers and $1 billion to raise employee wages and expand benefits.

Yet the deal has faced stiff resistance and new complications after a period of historic inflation. Two unions that represent Kroger and Albertsons employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters union, opposed the deal.

Higher prices of everyday food items fueled worries that a bigger company would have too much pricing power  concerns some politicians have echoed.

Higher grocery prices have irked consumers and become a hot topic on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, grocery chains drew the ire of Biden, who accused companies of ripping off shoppers while keeping profit margins high.

Together, Kroger and Albertsons would be a mammoth company and tighten a market share gap with Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S. Kroger and Albertsons also compete with regional players like Publix and Wegmans, and discounters like Aldi and Trader Joes.

Combined, the grocers would have about 5,000 stores across the U.S. The deal would marry Krogers approximately two dozen supermarket banners, including its namesake stores, Fred Meyer, and Ralphs with Albertsons grocery chains, including Safeway, Acme and Tom Thumb.

In an effort to overcome antitrust concerns, Kroger announced last year that it planned to sell more than 400 stores to Piggly Wiggly owner C",stocks,99.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0n2q0/ftc_sues_to_block_kroger_albertsons_merger_over/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9938709735870361
2024-02-27,1709061797.0,"Streaming to Overtake Pay TV Subscription Revenue in the U.S. This Year: it will hit $17.3 billion, topping $16.7 billion from pay TV.","***Hollywood Reporter:*** 

*Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast.*  
  
*Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. Streaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines  with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017, it predicts.*

*Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but streamings lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up, Ampere explained.*  
*U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firms projections.*  
*The ad tiers that streamers have added, from Netflix and Amazon Prime to Disney+ and the streaming services of other Hollywood giants, are one driving force of revenue. Streaming advertising revenue will pass the $9 billion mark in the U.S. this year, the Ampere study forecasts. The introduction of cheaper ad tiers has been successful not only in increasing new subscriber growth in previously saturated markets, but also in acting as an additional revenue source for streaming services, the firm explained. Revenue will be further bolstered by Amazon Prime Videos new advertising tier launched this quarter, it highlighted.*

*Most major streaming services in the U.S. have launched their hybrid advertising tiers, which, along with increasing clampdowns on password sharing, have been successful at reigniting growth in the streaming market, said Rory Gooderick, senior analyst at Ampere.*  
  
*Goodrick added, There is still a way forward for pay TV, however. Disney and Charters recent deal in the U.S., which gave almost 15 million Charter subscribers access to Disney+s advertising tier, shows how the two businesses can work together to maximize streamings reach to domestic subscribers and highlights the importance of traditional distribution platforms as service aggregators. Longer-term contracts and the reduction in churn make this an attractive proposition for streamers, while control over the billing relationship also means theres something in it for the pay-TV provider.*

In the dynamic and highly competitive semiconductor industry, AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) have demonstrated remarkable resilience, innovation, and market presence. Despite their solid fundamentals, both companies appear undervalued when considering their current market prices relative to their intrinsic value, future growth potential, and industry positioning. This thesis will explore the reasons behind this undervaluation, focusing on financial performance, strategic initiatives, market trends, and competitive advantages.

### Financial Performance and Valuation Metrics

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios:**
   - Both AMD and Intel have P/E ratios that are below the industry average, suggesting that the market has not fully recognized their earnings potential. AMD's forward P/E ratio is around 25, while Intel's is approximately 12, compared to the semiconductor industry average of 30-35.

2. **Revenue and Earnings Growth:**
   - AMD has exhibited robust revenue growth, driven by its strong product portfolio and increasing market share in both consumer and data center segments. The company's revenue grew by over 20% year-over-year in the last few quarters. Intel, despite facing competitive pressures, has maintained stable revenue streams, with significant contributions from its data center and Internet of Things (IoT) segments.

2024-09-16,1726517905.0,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsingers effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to evaluate independent sources of funding, and comes days after Intels board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone operating board and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand, Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intels quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidias general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the companys 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMCs forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMCs 3nm process are shipping now in Apples iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio thats currently under construction.

2024-09-12,1726103727.0,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. Its been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the companys cloud businesses. The stock didnt have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

The excitement is back, Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting momentum across all business.

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia  up 136%  among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracles rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth  18% in fiscal 2023  and four times the company has contracted.

After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits, JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the companys cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsofts headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company hed competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come, Ellison said on Mondays earnings call.

Oracle didnt immediately provide a comment for this story.

# No more passwords

For years, Ellison described Oracles database as autonomous, playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Teslas board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldnt need manual patching and wouldnt have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late hes benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazons market-leading cloud with Oracles full-featured database.

Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time, AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, hes now taking on passwords, which he calls utterly ridiculous because theyre insecure and can be easily hacked.

This is the way log-on is going to work, Ellison said on the earnings call. Im going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, OK, Hi Larry. Were done.

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so theres no reason his computer shouldnt be able to the same.

No more passwords, he said. Those have got to go.

2024-09-09,1725902300.0,Why ElasticSearch (ESTC) is still overvalued after a 30% drop this month,"I wanted to bring some qualitative discussion as to why I think Elasticsearch is only at the start of its downfall.

You'll need to know some history behind how Elasticsearch started and why it became so popular in the DevOps world. 

TLDR: They used to be opensource but Amazon basically stole their code and offered their service on AWS with the same name. Elasticsearch got pissed, changed their licensing from open source in 2021 and sued Amazon. Fast forward to today, theyve now settled with Amazon. However, since 2021, AWS has created their own competitor called Opensearch which is basically just a forked version of Elasticsearch with Amazons own contribution to it.... and they've been gaining a ton of market share.

The main reasons why

1. Engineering managers and open source devs that spent time on developing Elasticsearch open source got screwed by Elastic in 2021 and trust eroded

2. Opensearch is a part of the AWS ecosystem and why would a company go out of their way to add another vendor like Elastic if everythings already managed under AWS for them?

This graph shows a snapshot of the adoption of both:  
https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BOpenSearch%3BSplunk?

As you can see Opensearch is gaining more and more traction where as Elastic seems to be stagnating.

However, anecdotally, I think this is worse than it looks for Elasticsearch. I know for a fact internally teams still refer to Opensearch as Elasticsearch because it is just a fork of it.

  
I think this story will be similar to how Microsoft Teams due to its distribution channels completely swept up market share from Zoom. Similarly, I think this will happen with Opensearch and Elasticsearch.",stocks,33.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fcuvg6/why_elasticsearch_estc_is_still_overvalued_after/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9984808564186096
2024-03-31,1711920499.0,TKO - Owning  UFC and WWE could net you a FCF yield of 7-9% at current stock price. ,"First discussion Im posting here.  Hope you benefit from it.  As a warning it will be mostly point form.  Valuation is at the end if you want the TLDR.  Here goes. 

TKO group describes themselves as a premium sports and entertainment company that comprises the UFC and WWE.   

On September 12, 2023 Endeavour group (the then owner of UFC) and WWE closed a transaction to combine the two entities to form a new, publicly listed company (TKO group holdings).  Endeavour Group Holding (also publicly traded btw) remains majority shareholder with 51% of outstanding shares. 

Unfortunately, there is not much data that I could find on the combined group.  Financials that I found cover only January 1, 2023  December 31, 2023 for UFC and September 12, 2023  December 31, 2023 for the combined WWE and UFC.  Parent financials for are available for through Endeavour Group Holdings dating back only to 2021.  WWE financial reports are available back to 2000 as it was a separate publicly traded company.

History:
Both the UFC and WWE are household names and represent the most well recognized franchises in combat sports and wrestling entertainment respectively.  Additionally, both companies have long operating histories.  For reference the UFC just celebrated its 30th anniversary having hosted its first fight in 1993 and will be celebrating the UFC 300 event this coming April.  The WWE dates back even further, tracing its origins back to the 1950s being founded by either the father or grandfather of the well-known (and now somewhat infamous) figurehead Vince McMahon according to Wikipedia. 

About the business:
Under the new combined company the UFC and WWE will operate us separate entities.  The UFC will led by Dana White, who has served as president of the UFC since 2001 and grown it to a multibillion dollar business.  The WWE being led by Nick Kahn who joined the  WWE in 2020 and took over the role of President in 2021.

Per their 10K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 TKO group generates revenue from principal activities:

1. Media rights and content.
2. Live events.
3. Sponsorship.
4. Consumer products licensing.

1. Media and content:
TKO generates revenue from licensing live events and original programming to broadcasters domestically and internationally that carry TKO programming on digital and linear channels as well as pay-per-view.

These contracts last 35 years with broadcasters but they have some significant agreements lasting 710 years.

Broadcasters that have contracts with WWE or UFC include: ESPN, ABC, Comcast, Fox, Peacock, Tencent, Sony, Warner Brothers and now Netflix. 

Programming includes long and short for content, reality, series, and other filmed entertainment. Furthermore, TKO not only sells to distributors but also sells direct to consumers through UFC fight pass and WWE network.

2. Live events:
Live events generate revenue generation through ticket sales, site, fees, travel packages, and VIP experiences.

Between WWE and UFC generate 350 annual live events per year

3. Sponsorships:
TKO generates ad revenue and sponsorship revenue from sale of in-venue and in broadcasting advertising assets and digital impressions.

Ad revenues are driven by original content on third party social media platforms. For example, WWE has 100 million subscribers on YouTube and is the 12th most followed channel.

TKO group also has partnerships with major brands, including Anheuser-Busch, Draft Kings, GM, P",stocks,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bslgkz/tko_owning_ufc_and_wwe_could_net_you_a_fcf_yield/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9926948547363281

Drug stores have evolved from the time they first popped up and people love shopping there because its, convenient.  

Pros

-Amazon is an online retailer with no real retail space yet. Their first stores weren't done right. 

-Amazon already has an online medical clinic(One Medical) and pharmacy business that could be easily integrated together.

-Amazon with their analytics could easily stock each store and location with the right products from their online inventory making each store more profitable.

-Amazon has high shipping/delivery costs and growing each year. people are starting to have a package theft issue. Your local store can easily become a pick up spot of your packages, safely. Whole foods stores are very limited for pick up, same with pick up lockers. 

-Would also be a good returns spot, no need for Kohls or UPS eating into costs. 

-Could have bigger stores in some locations for a bigger variety of products and services. Kroger's has some grocery stores and some marketplace stores. Amazon is essentially a giant warehouse that has to ship everything to your doorstep. 

-Amazon is launching a Shein and Temu competitor, stores could easily offer cheaper products in the right neighborhoods. What usually deters people from making a purchase is the shipping cost, nobody wants to order $35 of stuff just to avoid the shipping fee, plus tax.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF todays stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramers high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors headlong rush into the American chipmakers shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidias artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the worlds most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that titleand $900bn in valueamid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang? Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidias boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S",stocks,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2momw/what_could_stop_the_nvdia_frenzy/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9968910813331604

2024-09-06,1725635922.0,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

2024-03-21,1711041638.0,Reddit pops 38% in NYSE debut to open at $47 per share,"Reddit shares jumped 38% on Thursday to open at $47 in the first initial public offering for a major social media company since Pinterests debut in 2019.

The 19-year-old website that hosts millions of online forums priced its IPO on Wednesday at $34 a share, the top of the expected range. Reddit and selling shareholders raised about $750 million from the offering, with the company collecting about $519 million.

Trading under the ticker symbol RDDT, Reddit is testing investor appetite for new tech stocks after an extended dry spell for IPOs. Since the peak of the technology boom in late 2021, hardly any venture-backed tech companies have gone public and those that have  like Instacart and Klaviyo last year  have underwhelmed. On Wednesday, data center hardware company Astera Labs made its public market debut on Nasdaq and saw its shares soar 72%, underscoring investor excitement over businesses tied to the boom in artificial intelligence.

Reddit is taking a haircut from its private market valuation of $10 billion in 2021, a boom year for the tech industry. The mood changed a year later, however, when investors became concerned over rising interest rates and soaring inflation and exited high-risk assets. In response, startups conducted layoffs, trimmed their valuations, and shifted focus to profit over growth.

Reddits annual sales for 2023 rose 20% to $804 million from $666.7 million a year earlier, the company detailed in its prospectus. The company recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, narrower than its loss of $158.6 million in 2022.

Based on its revenue over the past four quarters, Reddits $6.5 billion market cap at IPO gives it a price-to-sales ratio of about 8. Alphabet trades for 6.1 times revenue, Meta has a multiple of 9.7, Pinterests sits at 7.5 and Snap trades for 3.9 times sales, according to FactSet.

In addition to those companies, Reddit also counts X, Discord, Wikipedia and Amazons Twitch streaming service as competitors in its prospectus.

Reddit is betting that data licensing could become a major source of revenue, and said in its filing that its entered certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years. This year, Reddit said it plans to recognize roughly $66.4 million in revenue as part of its data licensing deals.

Google has also entered into an expanded partnership with Reddit, allowing the search giant to obtain more access to Reddit data to train AI models and improve its products.

Reddit revealed on March 15 that the Federal Trade Commission is conducting a non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models. Reddit said it was not surprised that the FTC has expressed interest in the companys data licensing practices related to AI, and that it doesnt believe that it has engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.

Reddit was founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the companys CEO. Existing stakeholders, including Huffman, sold a combined 6.7 million shares in the IPO.

As part of the IPO, Reddit gave some of its top moderators and users, known as Redditors, a chance to buy stock through a directed-share program. Companies like Airbnb, Doximity and Rivian have used similar programs to reward their power users and customers.

I hope they believe in Reddit and support Reddit, Huffman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. But  the goal is just to get them in the deal. Just like any professional investor.

Redditors have expressed skepticism about the IPO, both because of the companys financials and its often troubled relationship with moderators. Huffman said he recognizes that reality and acknowledged the controversial subreddit Wallstreetbets, which helped spawn the boom in meme stocks like GameStop.

Thats the beautiful thing about Reddit, is that they tell it like it is, Huffman said. But you have to remember theyre doing that on Reddit. Its a platform they love, its their home on the internet.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of Reddits major shareholders along with Tencent and Advance Magazine Publishers, the parent company of publishing giant Condé Nast. Altmans stake in the company was worth over $400 million before the stock began trading. Altman led a $50 million funding round into Reddit in 2014 and was a member of its board from 2015 through 2022.

*The time could be right for the NBA to one-up the NFL. ESPN is currently locked in negotiations to retain NBA media rights into the 2030s. The Association is currently negotiating a billion-dollar deal with ESPN and Warner Bros.

2024-03-05,1709671099.0,"Talk to me like I'm five - AI, and ebbs/flows in the stock market","TLDR I have done incredibly well in the market in the past 17 months and want to educate myself about the intricacies of the ebbs and flows of stocks. Any good suggestions for starting places to learn?


I pulled our 401k's (2040 target) in November 2022. Started with $90k in Amazon and then started liquidating other 401k's (we're in tech and switch jobs every couple/few years). I continued investing in everything AI adjacent, including Nvidia, palantir, c3, meta (wife worked there), Microsoft, AMD, super micro (didn't get in on this until this mid Feb), and a few others. I bought Amazon because I think they're future looks bright and didn't see it performing worse than the 2040 fund and then I basically just kept buying stocks related to AI.

Long story short, pulling out of those dog poop funds was the best financial decision I ever made. 

We're not touching any of these stocks for at least 15 years (even the ones in our brokerage account) because 1) we're 50ish and 2) I look at companies like Microsoft where even if you had invested at the top of the dot.com bubble, if you hadn't touched i the stock, you'd still be in great shape despite major market downtowns along the way. 

Now having said all that, I look at this portfolio every day, and aside from a couple company's earnings calls, it looks to my untrained eye that it's a lot of speculation based on a collective assumption of future growth in AI and that I just got in early. 

I know this is a stretch to ask on Reddit, but even with these 1-5% daily gains that I think are coming from people and institutions still racing to get their money into AI, what is triggering declines like today (-.2.5%)? Is it large blocks of money taking profits out, or people selling because they have set up some kind of triggers to get ahead of a declining market, or a million other things (most likely)?

Even though I don't plan on ""day trading"", I'd like to learn more about what's causing these ebbs and flows of money and I don't feel like anything on TV (and most of the ""shows"" on the Internet) give us an unbiased view of what's really going on. Any suggestions of where to start learning?

2024-03-05,1709651615.0,Target launches paid membership program as it chases new revenue streams,"Target on Tuesday said it will launch a paid membership program next month, riffing off the playbook of its rivals Amazon and Walmart.

The subscription tier, Target Circle 360, will include unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 in as little as one hour with no delivery fees and two free-day shipping, along with other perks. The retailer will continue to offer its free Target Circle loyalty program that offers special deals and sales throughout the year.

Target did not immediately say how much it would cost.

The big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Streets expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.

With the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.

Walmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.

Target is turning to its competitors playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the companys earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.

Walmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.

2024-03-04,1709587230.0,Has Spotify run up too much? They have a margin problem,"Spotify stock has gone on a huge tear lately, almost quadrupling its stock price from a recent low around USD 70-75 to currently over 271. Im sure this has to do with several consecutive earnings reports in which they demonstrated that they could:

1. Increase the number of subscribers and even re-accelerate growth despite their huge size
2. Squeeze more money from subscribers and increase ARPU, despite growing quickly outside of Europe and the USA where revenue per user tends to be lower. 


While this is positive news and doubling premium subscribers since 2020 (while facing heavy competition) is impressive, Im struggling to see how they will ever turn this revenue into profit. 

The problem is twofold:


1. Spotify is totally beholden to major music labels which operate in an oligopolistic market. Spotify pays royalties to labels whenever a song is played, and they cannot at all afford to lose any of the labels. No one would use a music streaming service that is missing the entire catalogue of all major artists signed to one of the labels. So as Spotify gets more users, not only do they automatically have to pay more money for more plays, the labels can renegotiate and demand more money. This problem becomes apparent in their gross margins (more on that later). 


2. Spotify is the only major pure play music streaming service. Their competition is Apple Music, Google/Youtube Premium, Amazon Prime. Excluding China, these make up well over 90% of the global market, but all their competitors have far more ability to bundle their services/subscriptions and run the music streaming at loss/breakeven by increasing royalty payments. Now, Spotify holds about 30% of the global market share compared to Apple Music at 13.7%, Amazon at 13.3% and Google at 9% (according to MIDIA Research). So they are the market leader by far which has its benefits. But switching streaming providers, while not totally painless, is easy enough that I believe they would lose a lot of subscribers if they raise prices too high. 


A few numbers that seem to underline my thoughts:


In 2023 they raised premium prices for the first time ever(!) in the USA, to 10.99. This is the same exact price as Apple and YouTube Music (without YouTube Premium). While a good deal for customers, it shows they have no pricing power. 


Their gross margin in the last quarter was 25.6%. Not only is this in fact lower than their gross margin right after their IPO 6 years ago (25.7%), it is a margin that doesnt seem to support their valuation of 3.6 currently. 


Premium subscriptions are their main source of revenue at 86% of total revenue. This number has not changed in over 2 years. Ad supported revenue not only has a terrible 11.6% gross margin but is not growing in a meaningful way. 


Their other initiatives like podcasting and some hardware experiments have mostly failed. In fact they decided to release the Joe Rogan podcast on other services despite sinking several hundred millions into it. they are now trying to push audiobooks and merch sales as new profit drivers. Those are nice to have but I doubt theyll make a meaningful difference. It seems to me if you are enough of a fan of an artist to buy their merch, you will just do it on their Website. 


Their one positive seems to be increasing free cash flow, which has roughly doubled in the past three years. They seem to be succeeding at generating some operating leverage. However with a 26% gross margin their biggest cost driver by far remains royalty payments. 


I guess the stock has some appeal as the market leader and main pure play publicly listed music streaming company, but to me it seems like a short candidate.

2024-03-04,1709581412.0,AWS acquires Talens nuclear data center campus in Pennsylvania -,"[https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has acquired Talen Energys data center campus at a nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.  
  
Talen Energy Corporation this week announced it has sold its 960MW Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania to a major cloud service provider  listed as Amazon in a Talen investor presentation. Amazon is yet to comment on the news.

According to the investor presentation, Talen sold the site and assets of Cumulus Data for $650 million. The deal comprises $350 million at close and $300m escrowed, released upon development milestones anticipated in 2024.  
  
""We are pleased today to have sold our Cumulus data center campus, unlocking significant value for Talen,"" said Talen president and CEO Mac McFarland. ""This transaction provides an attractive return on Talen's investment and vision in building Cumulus, and creates value through the sale of clean carbon-free power from our top-decile Susquehanna nuclear plant.""  
  
First announced by DCD in July 2021, the 1,200-acre campus draws power from Talen Energys neighboring 2.5GW nuclear power station in Luzerne County, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES). The company broke ground in 2021 and completed the first 48MW, 300,000 square foot (28,870 sqm) hyperscale facility early last year, along with a separate cryptomine facility.  
  
Talen said AWS aims to develop a 960MW data center campus. The cloud company has minimum contractual power commitments that ramp up in 120MW increments over several years; AWS has a one-time option to cap commitments at 480MW. The cloud provider also has two 10-year extension options, tied to nuclear license renewals  
  
As part of the deal, Talen will also supply AWS with energy via a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna site.  
  
Commissioned in 1983 for energy company PPL, the 2,494MW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the US. Its current owner, Talen Energy, was founded in 2015 after the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings.  
  
Talen Energy formed Cumulus Growth in 2020 to invest in opportunities created by the convergence of digital infrastructure and power and had two separate businesses; Cumulus Data, focused on hyperscale data centers; and Cumulus Coin, focused on digital currency mining.  
  
In an ESG report from March 2021, Talen said the company was well-positioned to capture value in areas such as data centers and digital coins, saying the two business areas could be a stable source of income outside of the traditional market.",stocks,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b6k4j4/aws_acquires_talens_nuclear_data_center_campus_in/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.994925856590271

In the end, **GCT seems to be just a Chinese dropshipper for furniture** (though it's expending it's range of products) and seems to have incredible growth figures in a currently difficult and costly market. The figures are being questioned in some circles(link removed, since seekingalpha is blacklisted) - but rightly so? 
I'm not sure, the corporate website looks quiet cheap, the marketplace looks a little better, but the page load is very slow, similarly to Alibaba. The products, especially the furniture, look rather old-fashioned (but I may be wrong my European perspective about that, maybe it suits American tastes in the lower segment). 

After a brief analysis on google shopping and amazon, you can find one or two products quickly that are also offered on Gigacloud, but based on the few or no reviews, there doesn't seem to be any particular bestsellers. 

So who is selling their stuff in the US and who is willing to buy those products (and where) - where does the massive growth come from?

Edit:

Also, their job offering hasn't changed at all since December 2023, can they really fill no positions or don't bother to update the website?

2024-03-18,1710793879.0,Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year,"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidias developers conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.

Nvidias share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAIs ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidias high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.

The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.

Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the companys developer conference in San Jose, California. Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.

The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.

Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.

The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways, said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. Of course, we still do that. But whats really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.

Das said Nvidias new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidias GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.

If youre a developer, youve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, well make sure that its runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people, Das said.

Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the companys Hopper architecture  used by chips such as the H100  which was announced in 2022.

Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.

The chip includes what Nvidia calls a transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.

The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.

Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. Thats much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.

Nvidia didnt provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems its used in. Nvidias Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.

Nvidia also announced its adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.

NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.

The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.

Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.

In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead, Das said.

Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

*Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*  
  
*To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*  
  
*The final list of named trends we researched was:*  
  
*-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*  
  
*-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*  
  
*-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*  
  
*-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*

*-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*  
  
*-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*  
  
*Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.*

2024-02-28,1709155285.0,Salesforce slips after the company calls for single-digit revenue growth,"Salesforce shares slid 6% in extended trading on Wednesday after the business software maker issued a light revenue forecast for the new fiscal year. It will start paying a dividend at 40 cents per share.

Heres how the company did, compared with estimates from LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.29, adjusted, vs. $2.26 expected

Revenue: $9.29 billion, vs. $9.22 billion expected

Salesforces revenue grew 10.8% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, according to a statement. The company reported net income of $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, compared with a loss of $98 million, or 10 cents per share.

During the quarter, Salesforce said it would acquire sales commission software startup Spiff for undisclosed terms and was starting to sell its products on the Amazon Web Services marketplace.

Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.37 to $2.39 per share, with $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been expecting $2.20 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.15 billion in revenue.

For the new 2025 fiscal year, Salesforce said it sees adjusted earnings of $9.68 to $9.76 per share and $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion in revenue. The revenue figure implies 8.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts had expected $9.57 per share, along with $38.62 billion in revenue.

My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now

**1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.

**2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.

**3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.

**4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.

2024-08-21,1724238216.0,"Target beats on earnings and revenue, but gives cautious sales outlook for the year  ","Target said Wednesday that sales grew about 3% in its fiscal second quarter, a return to growth after a prolonged stretch of sluggish sales and squeezed profits.

The discounter beat Wall Streets earnings and revenue expectations, as shoppers made more visits to Targets stores and website and bought more discretionary items like clothing.

Even so, the company stuck by its previous full-year sales forecast and struck a cautious note. Target said it expects comparable sales for the full year to range from flat to up 2%, but said it now expects the increase will likely be in the lower half of the range. 

Target raised its profit guidance, however, saying it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $9 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 and $9.60.

Shares rose more than 10% in premarket trading as Target showed improvement in generating profits.

On a call with reporters, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said Target took a measured approach with its outlook because its hard to predict consumers mindsets and the state of the economy in the coming months.

While weve been pleased with our performance so far this year, and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high, he said.

Heres what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.57 vs. $2.18 expected

Revenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.21 billion expected

Target, known for its wide array of trendy but low-priced merchandise, has been hurt as consumers buy fewer items like new outfits or home decor while they pay more for everyday expenses like food and housing. The big-box retailer has also struggled with reduced profits in recent quarters, as customers bought items like groceries that tend to be lower margin, and losses from damaged inventory and theft, including organized retail crime, took a toll.

Those trends improved in the second quarter, as Target attracted shoppers with new merchandise and reduced prices.

Targets net income jumped to $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Thats a more than 40% year-over-year increase.

Total revenue rose from $24.77 billion in the prior year.

Comparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, the first time in five quarters that Target posted a gain. The industry metric tracks sales online and at stores open at least 13 months.

Digital sales drove most of those gains, growing 8.7% in the quarter, as more customers used same-day services like curbside pickup and home delivery. Comparable store sales rose slightly, up 0.7%.

Target has tried to rev up sales and drive higher foot traffic by deepening loyalty and offering discounts. The company relaunched its loyalty program early this year and introduced a new paid membership, Target Circle 360, that includes perks like free same-day deliveries. Target threw its own sales event in July to compete with Amazons Prime Day. And it announced in May that it would cut prices on about 5,000 frequently bought items, including diapers, milk and paper towels. 

CEO Brian Cornell said customers have responded well to the price cuts and credited them for contributing to traffic growth in the quarter. 

Customer traffic across Targets website and store grew 3% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. The average size of customers shopping baskets, however, declined slightly, Fiddelke said.

Discretionary sales, which have been under pressure across the retail industry, improved. Target said apparel sales, for instance, grew more than 3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

Back-to-school has also been an important season for the retailer. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a call with reporters that the shopping season has matched Targets expectations, as many customers gravitate toward items with good value like backpacks that cost $5 and crayons that cost 25 cents. 

He said back-to-college shopping tends to be a longer season, as students gradually decorate their apartments and dorms.

Shares of Target closed on Tuesday at $144.33. As of Tuesdays close, the companys stock is up about 1% so far this year. Thats trailed behind the S",stocks,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1exmpzs/target_beats_on_earnings_and_revenue_but_gives/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9939129948616028

2024-04-19,1713542325.0,Ulta Beautys ($ULTA) Problems Are Not the Industrys Problems,"**The chains bleak outlook sent shares across the sector tumbling. But this weeks rosier take from Sephora owner LVMH suggests prestige beauty still has its place in an ever-crowded market.**

While cosmetics, skincare, fragrances and hair care have often been touted as small luxuries that consumers cant give up even in the hardest of times, the USs two biggest beauty retailers offered duelling outlooks this month.

Soon after earnings in late March, **Ulta Beauty chief executive Dave Kimbell laid out how the retailer was seeing demand for both mass and prestige segments slow meaningfully** at a J.P. Morgan conference on April 3. Hair care and higher priced makeup felt this pressure the most. The companys stock fell as much as 15 percent, and dragged down share prices at beauty companies ranging from Coty to even the can-do-no-wrong E.l.f.

But this weeks results from **LVMH posed a remarkably different picture for both its beauty retail business, Sephora, and its brands like Dior Beauty.** In fact, beauty was LVMHs brightest spot in its first-quarter results, announced Tuesday. Its **Selective Retailing unit, inclusive of Sephora, saw sales rise 11 percent on an organic basis.** This was followed by strong performance in the French conglomerates Perfumes and Cosmetics business group, which saw organic revenue increase by 7 percent; hero perfumes like Diors Savauge and Miss Dior continued to perform, while the brands ultra luxury positioning of its Rouge makeup launch was touted by the company.

How to explain these two wildly different outlooks?

Ulta Beautys moderation comes after roughly four years of positive, outsize growth, so it is no wonder Kimbells comments set off alarm bells. But many analysts said that Ultas tumble was overblown, and that its still too early to tell whether a beauty slowdown will be long lasting. I agree with that; running a beauty retailer is different from running a beauty brand, and we shouldnt assume theyre all feeling the same crunch.

But **Ultas bigger problem is its competition.** The retailers prestige makeup segment took a hit because there are simply more places to buy higher priced beauty, said TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen. Sephoras shop-in-shops inside Kohls department stores, which are often neighbours in the same strip malls as Ultas stores, are by far the biggest threat.

**Kohls said in March that it will introduce Sephora into 140 more stores by the middle of next year, on top of its current 910 locations. Kohls chief executive Tom Kingsbury said its Sephora partnership, which began in 2021, delivered $1.4 billion in sales in 2023.**

Its not just Sephora, though. Department store beauty sales have also been on the rise and more brands are selling on Amazon. (The Estée Lauder Companies finally took the plunge with Clinique in March.)

**Ulta only operates in the US,** so part of its issue is that it isnt being lifted by other markets like Europe and Asia. (The retailer plans to debut in Mexico next year.) Today, American consumers are navigating high inflation and rising credit card debit. Prestige beauty  makeup and skin care products priced around $30 to $80  has been in a tough spot for that reason. Aspirational shoppers seem to be more deliberate with their purchases, favouring either luxury (think: Dior Beauty, Creed and the like) or mass and masstige dupes.

**Sephora is expanding not only in the US, but also Europe and the Middle East.** That global footprint gives it options when certain countries or consumer segments slow down (the expansion hasnt been entirely smooth; Sephora announced it will shutter its Korean operations in May and continues to face intense competition in China).

For Ulta Beauty to regain share from its slew of competitors, its going to have to rely on the right mix of products, including exclusives to draw shoppers in store, and likely invest in higher touch clienteling. A greater push on its loyalty program would be additive, but perhaps its time to level up its own shop in shops in Target.

Until now, the partnership hasnt been an exact replica of Ulta Beautys owned assortment and visual displays, but judging with how Sephora and Kohls is performing, maybe it should be.

2024-04-23,1713870699.0,Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes,"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.

Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.

The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.

It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates  3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.

On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.

According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.

The stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.

The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.

Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.

Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.

Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion)  20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.

User figures

Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter  but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.

Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million  a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.

Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.

The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.

Profit pledge

Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.

Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.

Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.

That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs  three in 2023 alone.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.

In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""

The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.

The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.

Cooper's ""Call Her Daddy"" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.

Developers use HashiCorps software to set up and manage infrastructure in public clouds that companies such as Amazon and Microsoft operate. Organizations also pay HashiCorp for managing security credentials.

Citing unnamed sources, The Wall Street Journal said a deal could materialize in the next few days.

HashiCorp and IBM representatives both told CNBC they do not comment on market rumors or speculation.

Founded in 2012, HashiCorp went public on Nasdaq in 2021. The company generated a net loss of nearly $191 million on $583 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, according to its annual report. In December, Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder of HashiCorp, whose family name is reflected in the company name, announced that he was leaving.

Revenue jumped almost 23% during that period, compared with 2% for IBM in 2023. IBM executives pointed to a difficult economic climate during a conference call with analysts in January. The hardware, software and consulting provider reports earnings on Wednesday.

Cisco held $9 million in HashiCorp shares at the end of March, according to a regulatory filing. Cisco held early acquisition talks with HashiCorp, according to a 2019 report.

IBM shares slipped after publication of the Wall Street Journal article but quickly recovered.

They are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably wont do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.

Amazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesnt make much sense.

They are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. 

Their PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.

2024-05-01,1714562305.0,"CVS posts big earnings miss, cuts profit outlook on higher medical costs ","CVS Health on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that missed expectations and slashed its full-year profit outlook, citing higher medical costs that are dogging the U.S. insurance industry.

Shares of the company dropped 10% in premarket trading.

The drugstore chain expects 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 per share, down from a previous guidance of at least $8.30 per share. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting full-year adjusted profit of $8.28 per share. 

CVS also cut its unadjusted earnings guidance to at least $5.64 per share, down from at least $7.06 per share. 

The company said its new outlook assumes that higher medical costs in its insurance business during the first quarter will persist throughout the year. CVS owns health insurer Aetna. 

Still, CVS CEO Karen Lynch said in a statement that the the current environment does not diminish our opportunities, enthusiasm, or the long-term earnings power of our company. The company is confident we have a pathway to address our near-term Medicare Advantage challenges, she added.

Insurers such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group have seen medical costs spike as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. 

Medicare Advantage, a privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare, has long been a key source of growth and profits for the insurance industry. But investors have become more concerned about the runaway costs associated with those plans, which cover more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries. 

Heres what CVS reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $1.31 adjusted vs. $1.69 expected

Revenue: $88.44 billion vs. $89.21 billion expected

CVS reported net income of $1.12 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the first quarter. That compares with net income of $2.14 billion, or $1.65 per share, for the same period a year ago. 

Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets and capital losses, adjusted earnings per share were $1.31 for the quarter.

CVS booked sales of $88.44 billion for the quarter, up nearly 4% from the year-earlier period. That increase was driven by its pharmacy business and insurance unit. 

Meanwhile, CVS said sales in its health services segment, which includes the pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, declined during the period. That was mainly due to the loss of a large unnamed client, the company noted. 

In January, Tyson Foods said it had dropped CVSs Caremark and instead chose PBM startup Rightway to manage drug benefits for its 140,000 employees starting this year. That came months after Blue Shield of California, one of the largest in the nations most populous state, also dropped Caremark and instead partnered with Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cubans Cost Plus Drugs company. 

Those decisions add to an upheaval in the health-care industry, as startups promising lower costs and transparency challenge the largest PBMs and pressure them to change their own business models. 

The first-quarter results come as CVS pushes to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company. CVS deepened that push over the last year with its nearly $8 billion acquisition of health-care provider Signify Health and a $10.6 billion deal to buy Oak Street Health, which operates primary-care clinics for seniors.

Pressure on insurance unit

CVS health insurance segment generated $32.24 billion in revenue during the quarter, a more than 24% increase from the first quarter of 2023. The division includes plans by Aetna for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as dental and vision.

Sales blew past analysts estimate of $30.69 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. 

But the insurance division reported adjusted operating income of just $732 million for the first quarter. That is well below analysts expectation of $1.19 billion, according to FactSet. 

The segments medical benefit ratio  a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected  increased to 90.4% from 84.6% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that the company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.

Analysts had expected that ratio to be 88.4%, according to FactSet estimates. 

CVS said the rise was mainly driven by increased utilization of Medicare Advantage and the unfavorable impact of the companys Medicare Advantage star ratings. Those ratings help Medicare patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. 

CVS added that an additional day in 2024 due to the leap year also contributed to the higher medical benefit ratio. 

Health services, pharmacy businesses miss

The companys health services segment generated $40.29 billion in revenue for the quarter, a nearly 10% drop compared with the same quarter in 2023. 

The division includes CVS Caremark, which negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, along with health-care services delivered in medical clinics, through telehealth and at home.

Those sales were in line analysts estimate of $40.29 billion in revenue for the period, according to FactSet. 

CVS said the decline was driven in part by the loss of the unnamed client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. The decrease was partially offset by growth in Oak Street Health, Signify Health and specialty pharmacy services, which help patients who are suffering from complex disorders and require specialized therapy. 

The health services division processed 462.9 million pharmacy claims during the quarter, down from the 587.3 million during the year-ago period. 

CVSs pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $28.73 billion in sales for the first quarter, up almost 3% from the same period a year earlier. That segment dispenses prescriptions in CVS more than 9,000 brick-and-mortar retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as diagnostic testing and vaccination. 

Analysts had expected the division to bring in $29.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet. 

The company said the rise was primarily driven by heightened prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations. Pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the launch of new generic drugs and decreased front-store volume, among other factors, weighed on the divisions sales.

2024-04-18,1713473248.0,"NBAs exclusive TV rights negotiating window with ESPN, Warner expected to pass without a deal","The National Basketball Associations exclusive media rights negotiating window with current partners Disney
 and Warner Bros. Discovery
 is likely to expire Monday without a new deal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beginning next week, the NBA will be able to work on agreements for new partners to show packages of games. Amazon
, Apple
, YouTube TV, Comcast
s NBCUniversal/Peacock and Netflix
have all had preliminary conversations with the league expressing potential interest, CNBC reported last year. The exclusive negotiating window with the leagues incumbent partners officially ends Monday.

While no agreement is expected to be announced by the deadline, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery both continue to work on terms with the league, an NBA spokesperson confirmed. The NBA would like to bring in at least one new partner to serve as a flagship streamer, CNBC reported last year. The league wants a robust streaming partner that will use marketing and reach to make the games a priority on their platform, CNBC reported.

We continue to have productive discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery on a renewal of our media deals, a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

Spokespeople for Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.

Warner Bros. Discoverys TBS began airing NBA games in 1984, and TNT has shown NBA games since 1988. Disneys ESPN and ABC have broadcast the NBA since 2002. The two companies have both publicly expressed a desire to renew with the NBA and have joined forces with Fox to launch a new streaming service geared to sports fans that dont already pay for cable. That service will debut in the fall, the companies said earlier this year.

A more complex deal

The NBA is looking to double the $24 billion it generated from its previous media rights deal with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery by adding new partners and charging more for rights, CNBC reported last year. In 2014, during the NBAs last negotiation, the league renewed its rights with Disney and Time Warner about five months before the end of its exclusive negotiating window. The NBA also doubled the price for its rights in that deal from its previous agreement.

This time, the discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are more complicated because of the likely addition of a third party. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery arent eager to lose the rights they already have. Still, the league is looking for a large increase in fees, and neither company wants to carry the full burden of paying significantly more for what they already have, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

That allows for the league to bring in another party  or possibly even two more. The NBA could sell its new in-season tournament package of games to a separate media company other than its primary new streaming partner, one of the people said.

The value of popular live sports programming has increased because of its value to advertisers. While ad-free subscription streaming services have increasingly become the home for popular scripted programming, sports are still predominantly watched live, forcing viewers to see commercials.

Last years NBA playoffs was the most watched in 11 years across TNT, ABC, ESPN and NBA TV, according to Nielsen. The 2023-24 NBA regular season averaged 1.09 million viewers, up 1% from last year and the highest across-network average in four years, according to SportsMediaWatch.

Still, regular-season viewership plateaued this year among standard cable and broadcast networks. Across ABC, ESPN and TNT, the average televised audience of 1.56 million was down 1% from last years 1.59 million and was the lowest in three years. TNT averaged 1.4 million viewers for its 65 regular-season games, equaling the year prior, according to a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson.

The first round of the NBA playoffs will start Saturday.

Economic factors like inflation and interest rates are another nail in the coffin. People are tightening their belts, and gaming isn't exactly a necessity. Oh, and if they start issuing more shares to raise capital, say goodbye to whatever value is left in the stock.

Analysts aren't loving GME either  more downgrades could send this thing spiraling. And let's be real, if they can't keep up with tech trends like cloud gaming, they're toast.

2024-04-10,1712790600.0,Spotify (SPOT): $60B valuation on hopes of profitability for 2024.,"I love Spotify as a product and have been an investor since Q1 of 2022. In my opinion, it offers a superior user experience and is better value for money than competing services  even with recent price increases. I'm a big fan of founder and CEO Daniel Ek; he's proven himself as an exceptional innovator and leader by building Spotify into the industry powerhouse it is today. While Spotify is a household name, I don't think the average person fully grasps just how remarkable the company's success story is.  Against giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google, Spotify has not only held its ground over the years, but has consistently expanded its lead within the incredibly competitive music streaming world.

In early 2022, Spotify stock fell below pre-pandemic levels and after extensive research, I felt it was highly undervalued and initiated a long-term position in March. I added throughout 2022 and early 2023, bringing my average to around $130 - equivalent to a valuation of around $26 Billion.

I bought intending to hold the stock 'forever', and I have conviction that the fundamentals of the business will continue to improve over the long term. However, I am surprised to see $SPOT's valuation reach \~$60B so soon; I didn't expect sentiment to change so significantly until the company had achieved both consistently positive operating margins (for 2 or 3 consecutive quarters at least), and continued revenue growth at these levels at least into 2025.

User growth has been strong, free cash flows have grown nicely, and management has shown that their strategy is to now prioritise profitability - but even so, I can't see myself adding at $300 per share.

I am very curious to hear thoughts and opinions on $SPOT at it's current price. Is anyone buying? if so, I'd appreciate if you could outline your reasoning. Likewise, if you're bearish, feel free to explain why.

I've laid out some key metrics and figures below for additional context.

2024-08-14,1723617465.0,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now youre probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now youre probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing. 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you dont personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didnt decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor but Apple isnt cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Ok lets keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you dont use their products you personally know someone who uses them. Theyre everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and its expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels havent been seen since 2018.

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but Nike isnt cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why its down. Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowes

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home youre familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing youre paying attention to these two companies as theyre crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowes. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowes stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowes down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe youre not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and its only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease its only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and theyre causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally dont think so. However I think going forward we wont see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think about this theory.",stocks,121.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eruoyr/the_consumer_recession_of_20232024_and_the_future/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9423313140869141
2024-04-11,1712849961.0,Disney (DIS) DCF Analysis,"# Introduction:

Disney (DIS) is well-known globally for creating magical worlds and experiences for all their fans, having a long decorated history of significantly impacting the childhoods of kids worldwide. DIS clinched all 5 top spots for box office performance in 2019 ([SOURCE](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2019/)), as a testament to their ability to narrate engaging and captivating stories to a diverse audience globally. However, DIS has recently lost its magic with sub-par performance for its films, disappointing Direct To Consumer (DTC ) subscriber numbers, and a proxy battle with an activist investor. The future growth of DIS is unstable given that linear network which contributes about 15% of their revenue is rapidly phasing out and DIS is still hemorrhaging money on DTC.   


# Revenue:

Disney splits their business into 3 segments. Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences

***Linear Network***  
In the Dealbook Summit, Bob Iger believes that Linear Network is no longer part of the core business of DIS and should be running complimentary to other avenues of the business such as streaming.  
  
I dont believe Linear Networks will be present in the long run, Linear networks have a large price tag for consumers due to the long-standing price agreement between cable channels and cable distributors. On top of that, from an economic perspective, the investment into equipment required for both consumers and cable companies for Linear networks is significant so the price tag attached to Linear Networks will stay high. Compared to DTC which requires lesser investments.

2024-08-07,1723068521.0,Warner Bros. Discovery stock falls as it writes down $9.1 billion ,"Warner Bros. Discoverys stock dropped Wednesday after it reported a $9.1 billion write-down on its TV networks and missed analyst estimates on revenue.

Here is how Warner Bros. Discovery performed, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Loss per share: 36 cents vs. a loss of 22 cents expected

Revenue: $9.7 billion vs. $10.07 billion expected

The companys shares were down roughly 9% in aftermarket trading.

Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday reported the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which was triggered by the reevaluation of the book value of the TV networks segment. The book value was higher than the market value as traditional TV networks continue to see customers flee and advertisers are opting to spend on digital and streaming instead.

While I am certainly not dismissive of the magnitude of this impairment, I believe its equally important to recognize that the flip side of this reflects the value shift across business models, said CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels on Wednesdays earnings call, adding that the company is focusing on growth in the studios and streaming units.

He said Warner Bros. Discoverys balance sheet carries a significant amount of goodwill stemming from mergers and acquisitions, namely the combination of Warner Bros. and Discovery in 2022.

Its fair to say that even two years ago market valuations and prevailing conditions for legacy media companies were quite different than they are today, and this impairment acknowledges this and better aligns our carrying values with our future outlook, CEO David Zaslav said on Wednesdays call.

Executives highlighted Warner Bros. Discoverys continued mission of paying down debt, much of which stems from the 2022 merger. During the second quarter the company paid down $1.8 billion in debt. As of June 30, it had $41.4 billion in gross debt and $3.6 billion cash on hand.

The company also noted uncertainty surrounding future sports rights renewals, including the NBA. Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA in July, looking to forcibly invoke its matching rights on a package of games earmarked for Amazons Prime Video as part of the leagues new media rights deal.

Revenue for Warner Bros. Discoverys TV networks  a portfolio that includes TBS, TNT, Discovery and TLC  was down 8% to $5.27 billion during the second quarter, with both distribution and advertising revenue down in the segment.

However, the companys streaming business, centered around the platform Max, was a bright spot.

The company said Wednesday it added 3.6 million subscribers during the quarter ended June 30, bringing its total number of global streaming customers to 103.3 million.

The international expansion lifting subscriber growth, as well as increased ad spending on streaming, is propelling its streaming business toward profitability, executives said Wednesday, with the expectation that it would continue.

Zaslav also touted the streaming bundles Warner Bros. Discovery is forming  an entertainment pairing with Disneys Disney+ and Hulu  and a sports bundle with Disneys ESPN and Fox set to launch this fall.

Still, direct-to-consumer streaming revenue decreased 5% to $2.57 billion, driven by content revenue dropping 70% due to a lower volume of third-party licensing deals. Yet advertising revenue for streaming was up 99%, the company said, driven by higher domestic engagement on Max, and ad-supported subscriber growth. Global revenue also increased 4% driven by the ad tier.

Total revenue for the quarter was down 6% to $9.7 billion. Total adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased 15% to $1.8 billion.

2024-08-07,1723028834.0,"CVS slashes profit outlook on higher medical costs, says top Aetna exec will leave ","CVS Health on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings that topped expectations, but slashed its full-year profit outlook, citing higher medical costs that have been squeezing the U.S. insurance industry. 

The company also said Aetna President Brian Kane, the top executive at the insurance unit, will leave the company. CVS CEO Karen Lynch will take over management of the business and CFO Thomas Cowhey will also help to oversee it.

The retail drugstore chain expects 2024 adjusted earnings of $6.40 to $6.65 per share, down from a previous guidance of at least $7 per share. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting full-year adjusted profit of $6.97 per share. 

CVS also cut its unadjusted earnings guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.20 per share, down from at least $5.64 per share. 

It marks the third consecutive quarter that the company has lowered its 2024 profit guidance. 

CVS said its new outlook reflects continued pressure on its health insurance segment, which is seeing increased medical costs and the unfavorable impact of the companys Medicare Advantage star ratings. Those ratings help Medicare patients compare the quality of Medicare health and drug plans. 

CVS owns health insurer Aetna. The companys insurance division includes plans by Aetna for the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as dental and vision.

Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Elevance Health have seen medical costs spike as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements. 

Medicare Advantage, a privately run health insurance plan contracted by the federal Medicare program, has long been a driver of growth and profits for the insurance industry. But Wall Street has become more concerned about the runaway costs associated with those plans, which cover more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries. 

Heres what CVS reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

Earnings per share: $1.83 adjusted vs. $1.73 expected

Revenue: $91.23 billion vs. $91.5 billion expected 

The company posted net income of $1.77 billion, or $1.41 per share, for the second quarter. That compares with net income of $1.90 billion, or $1.48 per share, for the year-earlier period. 

Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets and capital losses, adjusted earnings per share were $1.83 for the quarter.

CVS reported sales of $91.23 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago due to growth in its pharmacy business and insurance unit. 

The company noted that sales in its health services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, declined during the second quarter. CVS cited pharmacy client price improvements and the loss of a large unnamed client.  

Caremark negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, along with health-care services delivered in medical clinics, through telehealth and at home.

Tyson Foods in January said it had dropped CVS Caremark and instead chose PBM startup Rightway to manage drug benefits for its 140,000 employees starting in 2024. Months earlier, Blue Shield of California, one of the largest insurers in the U.S.s most populous state, also dropped Caremark to partner with Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cubans Cost Plus Drugs company. 

Those decisions represent a larger upheaval in the health-care industry, as startups and the government work to increase transparency and lower costs for U.S. patients. 

Pressure on insurance unit

CVS insurance segment generated $32.48 billion in revenue during the quarter, a more than 21% increase from the second quarter of 2023.

Sales were in line with analysts estimate of $32.37 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. 

But the division reported adjusted operating income of just $938 million for the second quarter. That is below analysts expectation of $962 million for the period, StreetAccount said. 

The insurance units medical benefit ratio  a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected  increased to 89.6% from 86.2% a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.

That ratio came in lower than the 90.1% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

CVSs health services segment generated $42.17 billion in revenue for the quarter, down nearly 9% compared with the same quarter in 2023. 

Those sales were above analysts estimate of $41.25 billion for the period, according to StreetAccount. 

The health services division processed 471.2 million pharmacy claims during the quarter, down from 576.6 million during the year-ago period. 

CVS pharmacy and consumer wellness division booked $29.84 billion in sales for the first quarter, up more than 3% from the same period a year earlier. That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing. 

Analysts had expected the division to bring in $30.22 billion in sales, according to StreetAccount.

The rise was partly driven by increased prescription volume, CVS said. Pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the launch of new generic drugs and decreased front-store volume, among other factors, weighed on the units sales.

Also, does the probe have to succeed in order for competitors to benefit? Or is simply the shadow of the probe enough to give these competitors enough breathing room to increase their chances of success.

2024-03-07,1709841224.0,"Rivian shares surge as company reveals new EV models, $2.25 billion in cost savings","Shares of Rivian Automotive surged roughly 10% Thursday as the EV maker unveiled three new vehicles and announced more than $2 billion in savings related to pausing construction on a plant in Georgia.

Two of those EVs came as a surprise to consumers and investors. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, in announcing the companys upcoming R2 SUV, also revealed two additional crossovers called the R3 and R3X, a performance variant.

The R2 is expected to start at about $45,000 when it goes on sale during the first half of 2026. Its expected to be the fourth product for Rivian following a commercial delivery van and larger, more expensive R1S SUV and R1T pickup for consumers. The R1 vehicles start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000.

Scaringe disclosed few details about the surprise R3 crossovers, but told CNBCs Phil LeBeau that the R3 will be priced lower than the R1.

These represent our future, Scaringe said during a livestreamed event from Laguna Beach, California.

The announcements come at a crucial time for Rivian as it attempts to expand its customer base amid slower-than-expected EV sales in the U.S. after automakers flooded the first-adopter market with pricey all-electric vehicles in recent years.

Rivians sales pace has slowed in recent quarters, and the company widely disappointed investors last month by missing quarterly estimates and forecasting slightly lower production this year compared to 2023 due to plant downtime.

The Amazon-backed company has been burning through cash to improve current EV production and narrow losses.

Shifting production of the R2 from the in-development plant in Georgia to the companys plant in Normal, Illinois, will save $2.25 billion, Rivian said in a press release. It will also allow the vehicle to begin production earlier, it said.

The company said it will pause construction on the Georgia plant, to be resumed later.

The R2 will operate on a new EV platform but looks like a smaller version of the R1S SUV. It will be capable of more than 300 miles of all-electric range on a single charge and 0-60 mph time in under3 seconds, the company said.

R2 represents the essence of our brand, while targeting the significant midsized SUV segment, a massive market with limited compelling EV options beyond Tesla, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told investors last month. R2 has been developed with vertically integrated propulsion platforms, electronics and software to create an incredible user experience.

Why?

Crowdstrike actually did roll this out gradually, however their lab and test environments were all supported by AI which was tasked with ensuring all steps were green, as a result it wrote the appropriate test step to check and pass a malformed windows system file. 

Since all deploy steps were green Crowdstrike published their release. Clients set up for auto upgrade began upgrading and seeing the blue screen of death because the real world ended up being different than AI generated environment.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

TL:DR
I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.

Morgan Stanley analysts hiked their price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) (TSMC), citing improved prospects for the worlds biggest contract chipmaker from artificial intelligence-geared processors based on **Arm technology**. 

TSMCs price target was raised to T$928.0 from T$860.0, while Morgan Stanley analysts also maintained their overweight rating on the stock. The updated PT represents an upside of 16% from TSMCs last close of T$800.

Morgan Stanley analysts said that increased demand for processors based on British chipmaker **Arm Holdings**' (NASDAQ:[**ARM**](https://www.investing.com/equities/arm)) technology was expected to be an important growth driver for TSMC, given that the chipmaker makes almost 100% of all **Arm-based processors**. 

**Demand for Arm-based processors is expected to pick up amid increasing adoption of AI**, while TSMCs CoWoS chip packaging technology is also expected to factor into advancements in AI chip development.

Morgan Stanley expects TSMCs foundry share in global CPU markets will be close to **60% in 2028**, up from 37% in 2023, and will also become a bigger revenue driver for the firm.

Increased development of in-house, AI-geared silicon by major tech firms- such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)- also factors into improved prospects for TSMC, given that foundry work for the chips will be outsourced to the Taiwanese firm. 

AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- which is among TSMC's biggest customers- also develops its most advanced **AI chips on Arm**.

Increased demand for AI chips fueled stronger earnings from TSMC in the first quarter. But the chipmaker had also warned that AI demand may not be sufficient in offsetting a broader decline in chip demand, especially amid weaker global PC and smartphone sales. ",wallstreetbets,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cmuqp4/morgan_stanley_hikes_price_target_on_arm/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9936445951461792

2024-04-29,1714370373.0,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves","OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Most people remember BB as the dominant cellphone of the 2000s before Steve Jobs and his pancreas released the iPhone. BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.

So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**

**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**

* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.
* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. 

**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**

* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz
* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition

**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.

2024-01-30,1706624178.0,All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers,"When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that  
the numbers that they get are not accurate.   
if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.   
on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a ""paper gain""  
meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.   
that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.  
NONE of them do.  
For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.   
To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.   
you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT  
Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.  
Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.  
This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.   
The reason is the debt markets were socialized.   
You cannot have investments without price discovery  
Hilarious enough, the people who complain about ""wealth inequality"" have   
literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.  
LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.  
So,thereby making money worthless for investment.  
Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.  
WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?  
This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.  
Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.

Had a big loss on Microsoft recently - my own fault, could have sold for OTM calls for c.80% gain, but broke my rules and said fuk theta...then theta fuk'd me with a c.80% loss. This has been my only major loss, still up c.150% since July 2023, so don't worry about me :)

Have been researching ITM calls today and omg they seem incredible!!! Yes they are more expensive than ATM and OTM, but that's because of intrinsic value. The more the options are ITM, the higher the intrinsic value and  relatively the lower 'time premium', so therefore theta immaterially impacts the option value.

Going to buy ITM call options for Adobe next week in prep for earnings - c.25% down from the high, company still performing well (has a great moat). Understand it's down because of guidance saying performance will be weighted to h2, so q2 earnigns might have good q3 guidance (maybe?). Yea AI being a bit uneventful, but I'll take the risk. 

What has impressed me the most about ITM, is that as long as it stays at / above current share price, then I can sell for only a minor loss vs 100% loss - incredible!!!

Dell's new PowerEdge XE9680L server comes with direct liquid cooling and sports eight Nvidia Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs. GPUs are increasingly power data centers  in favor of the more traditional CPUs created by Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD) and others  as they are better capable of handling for AI workloads.



""Organizations are moving quickly to capture the AI opportunity, which is why our collaboration with NVIDIA is so important,"" Dell founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell said in a statement. ""Our expansion of the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA continues our joint mission  we're making it easy for organizations to implement AI so they can move boldly into this next technological revolution.""



""Generative AI requires a new type of computing infrastructure  an AI factory that produces intelligence,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang added. ""Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world's industries with a full-stack offering  including computing, networking and software  that drives the copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins of the digital enterprise.""



Dell and Nvidia are also working on the Dell AI Factory in an effort to speed AI adoption and innovation, the two companies said in the statement.

And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.

2024-05-22,1716348213.0,NVDA: Mixed Feelings Going Into The Print - AWS Is Forecasting Rough Seas Ahead - Stock Split Could Be Timely For Tomorrow's Earnings,"Nvidia has had the wildest ride these past months and shook out a 10% knife over a month ago. Brutal.

On top of all that you have rando's coming out saying they sold some profits off the top and the whole interest rate thing. Let's face it. Besides Google's break out, The Mag 7 has been sideways and hard to trade. Don't get me wrong, these companies have been up but they have also been punched in the mouth a few times. 

With that said, nothing is more peculiar than what Amazon has just done with the retiring of it's AWS CEO and more recently, their order cancellations of Nvidia's H200's. 

For me, the 2 things are very linked together. The notion that your massive cloud business has NO USE of H200's is a DAMNING statement. Not for AI, because Microsoft and Open AI are killing it right now, but specifically for Amazon AWS. 

How do you not have an ultra well-defined blueprint for where those H200's are going to go? The very notion that you would not have a plan to replace older accelerated compute AND OR expand your data centers is astonishing to me. 

The 2 companies could not be more world's apart in their AI trajectory. 

I listened to every word out of Satya's mouth on Microsoft's earnings call and the one key question that was asked over and over again was this, ""Why were your profits for AI cloud only 7% gains?"" The response was, ""There is too much demand."" Demand is outstripping supply. I can verify this is 100000% true. The one thing that is occuring with all planned projects out there in this space is the ability to service enmasse enough throughput per use case of AI compute. Now, a lot of that is latency which is improved with GPT upgrades such as GPT-4o. It's faster so you can put more throughput through the pipe and that is much better for everyone's use case and scalability. 

Moreover, Microsoft per this build event is putting AI everywhere in their product line. The AI is going to be coming out of your ears, nose and mouth. Open AI has invented HER. ScarJo lawsuits aside ""HER"" is here. It maybe version 1.0 but it's HER for sure. It is spectacular. And OpenAI keeps announcing this stuff everytime someone gets a whiff of thinking they are going to release something ""awesome"" for an AI offering. 

Everyone else is literally and desperately trying to catch up. On one hand, it's an ARM's race with Nvidia holding all the AI bullets. But in this war are there signs of defeat? In the very least there is some retreat. 

AWS may become the first casualty of the AI Wars. Reporting that they forgo an entire order of H200's makes absolutely no sense. They say they want to wait for the newer chips but that literally tells me your business model is in bad shape now and they see it in their books presently. 

Nobody, other than AWS cancelled their H200's. In fact, Sam Altman just was in a photo with Jensen getting their first H200. 

The implication here is for all other cloud providers, including sovereign nations, start to worry that they ultimately won't be able to compete on the scale and execution that Open AI and Microsoft have. 

The answer, to me, is that there is NO way, zero possibility, that the entire world is going to stand there and watch Microsoft and Open AI dominate the AI race. Asia's not going to back down, Europe isn't going to back down, Australia isn't going to back down under. Japan... Well, Japan is going to Open AI so. 

However, it is clear that AWS flinched and they're in trouble. While their cloud business may be fine right at this moment how long can them not having a frontier model start materially hurting their cloud business overall? 

Also, Microsoft's revenues are larger than many countries GDP. How much can the world really throw at sovereign AI in earnest when they don't even have the capacity to really compete financially if AWS can't even do it? 

Apple, has already capitulated and is probably going with OpenAI for their AI needs. Sora stopped a movie production studio from ever happening. 

Is this a consolidation of the AI power? 

Nvidia, must prove this quarter that this not the case. Those digital twins and DGX cloud systems need to show that there is great use. Meaning, I want to hear an analyst ask this question. 

1. What is the usage of the DGX cloud that is being provided by the major cloud companies and rest of world overall. Meaning, are people using DGX cloud offerings that are licensed and provided in the major cloud vendors. Apparently, not really for AWS. But that analysis is very important for how Nvidia data centers go. 

Yes, GPT/LLM's are one thing but all of other AI being done X GPT/LLM's and inference needs to be the lion share of the growth for Nvidia to keep powering forward.  

2. What percentage of AI workload in Nvidia's business is NONE LLM Related. This is a critical question because it would help to understand how much is all of this hype AI shit going on, how much is LLM usage, and how much is other things accelerated compute based that is not hype and or LLM training and usage. Where is the growth coming from? Robotics, protein folding, teenagers in their basement trying to make the next big video game. Where, What, Why and How. 

Even with the Nvidia offering all of their rock star concert conference offerings they are not going to realize billions from that for some time. 

I think they beat this quarter and give ok guidance. There will be a slight sell down and it gets picked up and eaten up the following day for a fantastic call heading into Q2025. 

The only way this stock doesn't go down with all of these headwinds that Nvidia must answer for is if they do a stock split. If they stock split this moons 15% over the week. 

I have a small position and looking to add more.

This is a very important little point in[Microsoft BUILD keynote](https://youtu.be/w1EepB0mCbE?si=_65UHAfSdYgpw-o-). The most advanced LLM model (GPT4) is running at a lower cost on AMD chips.

So Zalando is an E-Commerce Marketplace in Europe and they specialize in Fashion, while having about 7.000 Brands and over 1.8 Million Items on their Plattform.

Every Number i mentioned can be checked on the zalando investor relations website

Strategy:

So the company has a Revenue of about 10.5 Billion in LTM and a GMV of about 14.76. Right now around 40% of their GMV comes from third-parties and they try to execute the same strategy as Amazon is doing right now, which is selling less of their own fashion, which means the GMV should be growing faster than the revenue and the gross Margin should rise.

(Generally i think this development can be seen especially in E-Commerce Marketplaces, due to the E-Commerce Buisness being not that interesting, because of low barriers of entry, with Amazon FBA and Shopify, and not many Synergieeffects, resulting from taking different E-Commerce shops together. Here the only good Differentiations are good reviews or a Brand that people remember, which often goes together. But that just on the side.)

Also like Amazon they provide a Fullfillmentsolution to their Partners, which is also growing in the adoption of the third-party-sales on Zalando. Another interesting area is their acquisition of Highsnobiety, which provides a Fashion Newsfeed, that could enhance Sales through the Inputs provided by the News and could further enhance time spent on the Zalando website and App, which improves customerconnection and Sales.

I even think, that a Marketplace in the fashion e-commerce space should be even more interesting as a buisness model, than amazons marketplace model right now, due to the higher margins on the products, which can also lead to way higher comissions, than Amazon can charge for 10 meters of tape or something like that. So Zalando can maybe profit from their partners brands and the differentiation, that comes with them.

Financials and Macro:

So even though the strategy sounds pretty good, the numbers haven't performed in the same way. This is mostly due to 2022 and 2023 being pretty rough years for E-Commerce, due to people shopping a bit more in the real world again and mostly just the macro being much worse in general. The problem with fashion is, that it is very cyclical, because these expenses aren't life preserving and can easily be cut back a bit. Furthermore nearly all big fashion players in Europe, like About You, Asos and so on orderd way to much inventory in 2021, because they thought the E-Commerce trend would go on like in the covid times. (This can be seen pretty nicely, when visiting the $YOU ticker for About you or the $ZAL for Zalando and looking on the inventory as a percantage of revenue. - which should, with Zalando getting more of their revenue through comissions and other revenue streams, decrese -

These Problems caused Zalandos GMV to shrink right now with -2.5 %, with active customers in LTM also shrinking Q on Q. However this has to be seen relative to industrie peers, for example Asos shrinking -10 % or boohoo also - 10% and About you also slightly shrinking with -0.5%. So here you can see Zalando and About you taking performing way better than the rest of the European e-commerce market.

A Development which is especially linked to the high inventory levels is way lower gross margin, visible at every of the before mentioned companies. This comes from every Fashionshop trying to sell their inventory off, because they want to avoid big depreciation and amortization expenses. However this process is now close to being done, with many of the mentioned e-commerce shops having way healthier inventory numbers. So I don't see any reason, why the gross margins shouldn't climb back to the levels we saw before the last two years, which would be at Zalando from around 38% on average to about 42%.

So just this effect could get margins from around 2 % for the full year up to 6 %. Furthermore Zalando would, if their GMV grows at the 8% Cagr, that is predicted for E-commerce in Europe till 2029, certainly increase their operating margin to maybe 8-10 % with an Operating leverage (revenues growing with 4-6 %) and more profitable revenue thorough comissions and services for their third-party-sales. And the numbers mentioned are in my opinion quite conservativly estimated.

Now to their Balance Sheet: They have

around 2.2 billion in equity, however this surplus could be lower if they still have problems to sell their slightly elevated inventory levels, so we rather say 2 billion adjusting for the risk.

Market Cap: 5.17 Billion

So you would pay around a 0.3 Price to Revenue multiple if you subtract the equity from their market cap, but mostly you can't do this exactly, because the equity won't return around 7 % year on year(as the msci world), so we say it's rather a 0.4 price revenue multiple. So you pay a 0.4 revenue multiple, for the biggest Fashionmarketplace in Europe, where the market is estimated to grow around 8 % on average y on y to 2029 and the operating margin of Zalando can be expected to increase from the 2 % right now very fast to around 6 %, and long term to 8-10 %. with a 6 % operating margin you would pay around 7 times earnings(with 10 billion in revenues) for this very likely growing buisness, with further margin improvement to go.

Risks:

The most important risk i see comes of course from Asia, with Temu and Shein. They just produce with much lower costs than the brands in Europe and sell to much lower prices. However i think that especially in Europe there is still a big interest in owning and wearing brandclothes and another trend which further supports this trend is people more and more expressing themselves through clothes. So surely Temu and Shein will take some share, but more from Shops like H",investing,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1aw6pkf/stockanalysis_on_zalando_europe_ecommerce_player/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9946236610412598

2024-03-13,1710294252.0,Due Diligence on Penny Stock with a current P/E of about 4/1,"I put together a little writeup I've been sending to friends, I'd honestly love any questions or concerns as I'll be keeping a very close eye on Terawulf over the coming months. It's also lacking a lot of technical jargon when it comes to Bitcoin Mining and investing since not all my friends are not super versed in crypto and investing.  
Company : Terawulf  
NASDAQ stock Ticker : **WULF**  
Based out of Maryland, USA  
**SYNOPSIS**  
The WULF stock price of $2 is very very undervalued.  
This belief is heavily based on the fact that after expenses the company is currently pulling in $500,000 a day (including weekends), yet its market cap or total value of the company is only about 500 million.  
Imagine buying a penthouse for $5 million dollars and then being able to rent it out at a fair market price for $1.8 million dollars a year. It would seem as if the penthouse was sold for way under value.  
Below is an in depth explanation on why Terawulf is way under value.  
**WHAT DOES TERAWULF DO?**  
Terawulf has built two facilities in New York and Pennsylvania that are basically two huge state of the art computers. Theyve built these computer facilities to create an enormous amount of computing power. They then use this computing power to make money.  
For Example: AI or artifice intelligence requires a lot of computing power. Terawulf is currently working with Talen and Amazon where they might sell their computing power to Amazon to power Amazons AI. Basically Amazon rents Terawulfs facilities computing power, instead of building their own.  
This potential Amazon deal is however a speculative future endeavor and not why I am writing this today. It just helped me explain what Terawulf has built without using the scary B word... Bitcoin.  
However, thats exactly what Terawulf is doing with their computing power.  
They are mining Bitcoin or using their computing power, to help run the Bitcoin network. Similar to how Google could hire Terawulfs computing power, to help run their email system GMAIL.  
Terawulf, gets paid in Bitcoin daily, and immediately sells it for a hefty profit. The Terawulf CEO has invested millions of his own money into Terawulf and stated that the company is not in the business of speculating on the price of Bitcoin. They simply Mine Bitcoin everyday for a profit in American Dollars, not Bitcoin.  
**TERAWULFS BACKSTORY**  
TERAWULF was formed in 2021, and their plan was to lock in long term cheap North American power (5-20 year plans). Not just any power, but Zero Carbon energy. Not only is it better for the environment, but in a world where regulations are moving in that direction, its better to be ready for it.  
Once they locked in inexpensive green power, they bought land and started construction on buildings. Right now they have buildings in New York and Pennsylvania. Two states that have had discussions and laws even passed against companies mining bitcoin... but mining bitcoin with bad energy. Since Terawulfs goal is 100% carbon free energy, they dont have to worry.  
Terawulf spent all of 2021 - 2022 getting their facilities ready. They started turning on the computers in 2023, but are still building and turning on new machines for 2024, and anticipate this continuing into 2025.  
This all leads into why I believe they are so undervalued.  
**STOCK PRICE**  
Terawulf began this venture in 2021, during the last cryptocurrency bull run. Speculation was crazy in 2021 around anything crypto and Bitcoin related. Along with many other assets and mining companies, WULFs price rocketed to a high of $44 per share in Nov 2021.  
However soon after Bitcoins price went down and so did Terawulfs. WULF shares dropped as low as $0.53 in March 2023.  
Rightfully so, I mean Terawulf up until that point had just taking on hundreds of millions in debt to build their facilities. According to their earnings reports this company just lost money month after month, year after year. They were an idea in 2021.  
Most people dont know what Bitcoin Mining is, so they see Terawulf, they see its a bitcoin mining company and dont really know what the hell that means.  
Theyre investors not computer tech folks. So they look at what they do know, the earnings reports and well, the earnings reports are terrible. They dont know why or care, however we now know its because Terawulf is still in the building stages.  
Its as if Ferrari spent over two years building a race car. But every month people asked how fast the race car was, and Ferrari said it went 0 mph. So everyone continued to write off this race car as a failure, without knowing that it was going to take 3 years to build.  
They shouldnt judge how fast it goes until its built, just like the market shouldnt have judged Terawulf on how profitable it was before it was built.  
I think the stock market thinks Terawulf is a fully built race car that goes 0mph, when in reality it is a half built race car that when fully built, will be the fastest car in the race.  
Earnings reports are a major factor in how investors judge a company. Most articles and reports online are based off Terawulfs released earnings reports. Those earnings reports dont go past sept 2023, and those reports are very bad.  
Currently, when you research Terawulf online, youre likely to find a writeup that an algorithm wrote based off earnings reports before Oct 2023. The reports are filled with BAD numbers, and dont explain that Terawulf was simply building their race car.  
Now normally everyone has to wait until the company releases its earnings report to know how everything going. Not with Terawulf though.  
Terawulf is not your average company, they are very transparent and have been releasing their numbers on their social media and their website. They are proud of what they accomplished and believe in a company that doesnt hide behind walls, but instead informs investors of exactly what is going on.  
They dont pay for fancy marketing, they just make a damn good product and wait for word to catch on.  
However, NOBODY is reading Terawulfs reports... their twitter posts get maybe 100 likes, and a few spam comments.  
So unless youre one of the few like me listening, you are judging their company on the terrible earnings reports from 2021 thru September 2023.  
However they just started turning on their machines in 2023, and have been expanding at a rapid rate throughout 2024.  
On Fidelity and Charles Schwab if you click on reports for Terawulf and look at earnings... MISSED in big red letters pops up.  
For investors its basically saying LOSER LOSER LOSER, over and over and over.  
However, on March 28th 2024 the official earnings report comes out for Oct-Dec 2023.  
Now if youre following Terawulf on social media and understand Bitcoin Mining youd know that Q4 was a bit of a winner this time. Youd also know that Q1 of 2024 is an even bigger winner. However, the vast majority of people simply wait for the official earnings reports.  
Basically we are ahead of curve by 6 months.  
I dont know when exactly Wall Street is going to catch up on this, but right now WULF seems like a diamond in the rough. The confusion around what exactly is Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, mixed with the delayed earnings reports has falsely labeled Terawulf a loser.  
I anticipate that between now and summer of 2024 the market will catch on.  
We discussed the price of the stock versus the earnings of the company. This is called a P/E ratio for short. Terawulfs P/E ratio right now is about 4/1 since the entire value of the company is four times more than their gross earnings for the year.  
In comparison to the software industry average of 56/1 which is what fidelity chose to compare it to Terawulf to.  
A 56/1 P/E for Terawulf would value the stock $28 a share instead of $2 a share.  
MARA Marathon Digital is a mining company that has a current P/E of 23/1. WULF at $11 a share would be a 23/1 P/E.  
Now there are many other factors to consider and I think $10 a share is closer to a fair value.  
I also think the stock could go to $100 a share considering how crazy the market can get, especially around something with the word Bitcoin in it.  
However I am not an expert with how to value a company like this, should it be 3 billion or 10 billion, Im not sure. What the stock market values is a best guess.  
Theres so many things to consider, and nothing is guaranteed in this world. A comet could hit the Terawulf facility and blow it up tomorrow and drive the price to a few pennies.  
Im not a finial advisor, I have no idea your finances nor can I guarantee my beliefs or that I am missing something. Im simply stating what I find interesting about this company and sharing that info and my beliefs.  
Anyway, thanks for reading. Below is some more info to consider.  
**DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE**  
SHORTS  
Another reason why the price is so low, are the shorts have been opening up on this stock since 2022. This is just speculation, but I believe these shorts are coming from knowledgeable traders, who understood they would be out of profit for two years, or lenders who have hedged their investment.  
For anyone who doesnt understand Shorts, its basically a way to make money if the stock price goes down, and coincidently, investing in a short position on a stock helps drive the price down.  
The shorts are slowly beginning to close and I have a feeling those shorts will close up completely by June 2024. Shorts closing brings stock price up.  
TRENDING BUZZ WORDS CREATING HYPE  
To add fuel to the fire, Terawulf prides itself in using green clean energy thats carbon free, a very popular narrative. One thing Ive learned in trading is that the best story often wins out. They also announced in Dec 2023 that theyre working with amazon and A.I. to capitalize the use of their mining machines.

Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S",investing,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9871900677680969

2024-04-18,1713450254.0,Will NVDA Bounce Back,"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead.",wallstreetbets,52.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c74nbv/will_nvda_bounce_back/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9993098974227905
2024-02-29,1709244699.0,Why is mister Market allowing a 8% discount for a fund?,"Currently the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. (ASG) is being sold at a 8% discount. It's net asset value is 5.88$ per share, yet Mr. Market says that it's price is 5.41$.

Is the market irrational or am I missing something here?

I know that the fund has around 1.1% management fees, but this is on a yearly basis while the discount is happening on a daily basis. The fund also has 8% dividends. You could argue that the 8% dividends are the reason for the 8% difference in the market price, but you would be wrong, as again the dividend is paid on a quarter basis of just 2%, so it's again 6% free money till the next ex-dividend date. If the fund liquidate all it's assets the owners would have 8% of their investment's value for free - no dividend involved here, just pure liquidation of stocks, so no discount for selling physical assets etc. Besides giving out 8% of dividends is a good reason to value the fund higher than it's net value, no?

[https://www.all-starfunds.com/asg](https://www.all-starfunds.com/asg)

I know that the fund has been performing bad over the last year, but after all the net value is higher than the market price which seems like easy money.

One thing I don't understand is how is this fund is able to provide 8% dividends? It doesn't make sense due to the high diversification and the presence of stocks like Amazon in it - Amazon gives 0 dividends and many of the other holdings are giving out little dividends.

Bottom Line: 
We remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1/24 resultsas we believe that CLS will continue to benefit, both in the near-term and longer-term, from the large AI-driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers. We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity, nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative.

Key Points
We anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise. Consensus Q1/24 estimates call for revenue of $2.1b and adj. EPS of $0.72, while FY2024 consensus is at $8.78b for revenue and $2.93 for adj. EPS.

The companies that did have a profit, were making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didnt meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

2023-12-31,1704013141.0,Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded. 

How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact. 

Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management? 

This cancellation doesnt look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time. 

At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example). 

Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons. 

For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs. 

This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms. 

Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they dont seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.

2024-06-20,1718894769.0,NVDA has been all the rage and justifiably so. ,"Since NVDA reporter its Q1 2023 earnings, revealing huge demand for AI chips, the stock has surged to $3.3T. Revenues 4x, margins up expanded and everything seemed perfect. Bulls claimed the stock was getting cheaper to decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has dropped from 88% to 34% to 18%, heading towards single digits. Next quarter well see just 7%. 

All of the marginal buyers are in  sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests  short term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, when the ducks are quacking, feed them. 

If the quarterly revenue growth continues to moderate, earnings growth will be impacted as well  making the stock become more and more expensive (multiple screams higher) versus the theme of last year when the higher it climbed the cheaper it got. 

This does not change the fact that it is a great business with a great leader  which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. Its just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon, Microsoft or the entire German Stock Market Capitalizations (where it trades now). 

NVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business  its cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70% gross margins, as Bezos famously said, your margin is my opportunity. NVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intels Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDAs H100 and 40% more energy efficient. AMD is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company. NVDA is a great company and will continue to innovate. We are in an AI/productivity revolution. I would never bet against it. However&

Price is what you pay, value is what you get& Caveat emptor at these levels. What may go even higher in the short term can go a lot lower in a blink. The table is set

2024-06-20,1718917643.0,"My Thesis on IonQ
","Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.

# Stock Performance

First off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so theres definitely room for growth.

# What's New with IonQ?

IonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and its a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.

# Management Changes

Theyve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the companys strategy and growth. Plus, theyve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.

# Industry Positioning

IonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platformsAmazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means theyre super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.

# Financials

Financially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. Theyve got a lot of cash on hand$434.4 millionso theyre in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.

# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?

Now, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If youre looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Heres why:

1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.
2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but theyre not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.
3. **Valuation**: IonQs stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIAs, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.

In summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.",wallstreetbets,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dkmiva/my_thesis_on_ionq/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9522701501846313

2024-02-13,1707860490.0,Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024,"The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.

As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued. 

Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia. 

Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.

With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.

Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.

\---**Major current buyers:**

* **Cloud giants:**
   * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.
   * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.
   * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.
   * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications.
* **Tech companies:**
   * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.
   * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.
   * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.
   * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.

\---**Potential future buyers:**

* **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings.
* **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow.
* **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.

\---**Global reach, with limitations:**

* Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.

\---**Export controls and restrictions:**

* However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.

**Examples of restrictions:**

* In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications.
* Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies.
* Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.

**Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**

* **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers.
* **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements.
* **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.

The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.

Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?


Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. ab can be 1 token, can another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPUs and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run. 

Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4. 

Well ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.

TLDR; OpenAIs foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AIs. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.",wallstreetbets,75.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1arrumb/nvidia_will_cross_2000/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9979220032691956

2024-02-16,1708105138.0,Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  
 

It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.

First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?

You could say its because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  
It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.

AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.

How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But its not just any Product. Its a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.

This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).

This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.

They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.

How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.

Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:

\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees

\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)

\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)

\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers

The Analogy:

Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).

TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.

The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.

At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.

Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.

Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.

What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.

Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.  
   
 \----

NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.

Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and thats their moat. This tells me that the person doesnt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.

NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They only design them.

Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? Its TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.

So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big Chip Design Company. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult moat part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.

There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.

So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.

Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.

AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.

Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime theyre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.

According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.

Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!

Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:

However, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apples GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidias GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.

Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apples commitment to developing its own graphics technology. ([Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)](https://ts2.com.pl/en/does-apple-use-nvidia/)

Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:

2024-02-19,1708378562.0,Analyst Lead Time Stories For Nvidia Don't Make Sense Regarding Decreased Growth When Growth Comes from Data-Center - SORA Proves Otherwise,"Somehow or another UBS (The same people who upgraded Chargepoint to $7/8 per share right before it crashed) is complaining about a reduced lead times for Nvidia is somehow a bad thing.

Let's break this down.

So you're trying to convince me a company that had 11+ months of lead time working towards expanding production capacity so that the lead times are cut to 4+ months is somehow doing something wrong?

At first glance, wouldn't reduced lead times (by 50%) expect a massive increase in profits for that current quarter because you were effectively doubling your order output from a booked sales POV?

As well, why would UBS question this portion of growth when in fact 80%+ of their business is coming from their data center which has nothing to do with booked sales of their product. How are they confabulating lead times with growth when the growth is the data center.

Mark Zuckerberg/Meta and others are reporting massive purchases for product because they have the internal capacity to either USE and or RESALE work that comes from these products. The same goes for AWS, Microsoft and Google.

Another dumb thing that analyst are repeating is that once you buy these chips you won't need to buy them again.

Do you have kids that have gaming pc's? LOL. You only need to ask a gamer standing outside at 4am of BestBuy to understand that in the chip world and GPU world the next specs are EVERYTHING!

What you think you could do today with chipset A is nothing you can do next year or 2 with chipset B. Analysts not understanding this simple concept is (seeking alpha) alarming to me.

Let's go back to what Jensen said at the WGS. Compute in the past 10 years has increase by a whopping 1,000,000 time.

This was his argument for why we won't need $7 trillion going into chip fabs. However, this is him not knowing about OpenAI's SORA.

[SORA was a literal ""See I ain't fucking around"" mic drop from Sam Altman.](https://openai.com/research/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators) When I ask for $7 trillion I am not kidding around.

Let me explain this visually for you. The first video is at base compute. The second video is scaling that up by 4x and the third is when you scale up by 32x.

Let's be rock solid clear. This isn't just about video's of cute dogs.

Cloudflare is used by 78.0% of all the websites whose reverse proxy service we know. This is 18.8% of all websites.

The company is unique because it owns its underlying network and is not hosted on one of the big public cloud providers. This was a pivotal decision made in the early days at Cloudflare, because it required making fixed cost investments and solving difficult software engineering problems. There are hundreds of Cloudflare data centers (known as points of presence or POPs) around the world and 95% of the internet connected world is within 50 ms of the Cloudflare network.

People familiar with the HBO show Silicon Valley know of the fictional startup Pied Piper and the idea of a decentralized peer to peer internet. Cloudflare has some interesting parallels to that idea with a decentralized approach to their data centers. Each data center is built with the same hardware, and is not specialized for any one use case like what many other cloud infrastructure providers have built out. This allows any data center in Cloudflares network to run any app or service and software controls everything.

Management breaks down their strategy down into 3 acts:

Act 1: Application Services

The company initially focused on offering a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver and host cached website assets around the world. It takes time (albeit not a lot) to make a network request and ultimately the speed of light traveling through the fiber optic cables is the limiting factor. Today, when you visit a website, instead of going all the way to a centrally located data center (such as Amazons us-east-1 data center located in northern Virginia), your network request likely hits a CDN near where you are located and delivers a version of the website.

Historically, CDNs were very underpowered and primarily handled only storage use cases. You can think of Cloudflare as one of the first enablers of compute power for CDNs. Cloudflare also took a software defined networking (SDN) approach that did not require physical boxes on premise. Many companies to this day have physical boxes to handle networking and application services that arent adapted to todays cloud native environment.
There have always been other CDN providers in the market but Cloudflare took market share by bundling its offering with other best in class networking and security products (such as DDoS protection) effectively for free. This allowed it to amass a free user base of over 3 million people, something rare for an enterprise software company.

Act 2: Network Services and Security Services

The next chapter for Cloudflare was the rapid launch of security products. The most prominent of this group is their suite of Zero Trust Security products. Zero Trust could be explained in much greater detail, but Ill attempt to do so at a high level. Traditionally, corporate networks were built under a castle and moat model. Once you got past the moat (getting credentials or any sort of access) you were in with the power to do anything within the company network. 

The Zero Trust philosophy is that when an employee accesses any individual resource, they should be authenticated and they should only have access to what they need. Cloudflare provides the infrastructure to enable this and competes with companies like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.
Cloudflare offers many other Act 1 and Act 2 products and to not kill my readers from boredom (if they even made it this far), Im going to end this section here.

Act 3: Developer and AI Services (and other Future Trends)

Cloudflare is benefiting from this market euphoria and is establishing itself as one of the early beneficiaries of AI. Cloudflare has evolved over time to position itself as the fabric that ties together the different clouds. Cloudflare sits atop of the other cloud infrastructure providers and is well suited for some AI workloads. Customers already include top AI companies and startups like OpenAI and Hugging Face. 

One example of this market positioning is Cloudflares object store called R2 (one less than Amazons object store called S3). Based on a market survey, it seems that S3 could be about a $1B revenue business (which almost equates to the entire revenue of Cloudflare today). 

Amazon makes a strategic move with S3 to charge users to move data off their cloud, but not charge to move data in. The costs to transfer out are known as egress fees, and this is inflated to cost users exponentially more than what it costs Amazon. Intuitively this does not make sense because Amazon made fixed cost investments to set up their network. Data travels in and out on the same fiber optic cables they laid out in the past. It doesnt make sense to charge different prices for data in vs data out since the underlying cost is the same and approaches 0. The key objective for Amazon is to lock you in. Amazon stands to benefit if customers pick them and over their competitors. Cloudflare on the other hand, actually wants to enable so called multi cloud systems, since it can serve as the control plane for data movement and capture that new market.

With egress fees it can be economically unviable to use multiple cloud providers. Say Microsoft has the best AI APIs because of their OpenAI tie up, but youre a user of AWS. Moving the data off AWS to use the Azure offering would cost a lot of money. Often times, training data sets are also massive, so moving them is even more costly. Cloudflare eliminates this cost and is slowly becoming a platform of choice for AI startups for this use case.

Another market that Cloudflare seems poised to capture a share of is what is known as inference, the act of AI models making conclusions and judgements. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it is doing inference. It is attempting to make a prediction based on all the training data it has. Most use cases of AI will likely be inference since you want the model to generate a response based on what you ask it. A lot of inference today occurs in the centralized data centers and high latency adversely impacts customer experience. When Cloudflare built out their network, every point of presence was built out with the same hardware and they even reserved a slot for GPUs, processors needed for AI workloads. Now, the network can easily be upgraded and retrofitted with GPUs with minimal additional capital expenditures. Cloudflare management thinks a lot of AI inference will likely happen closer to the end user, since it is not as demanding as training which has to be done in the centralized data center. 

We are seeing this inference cloud of sorts from Apple as well, further validating this idea. I need to read more, but Apples Private Cloud Compute they announced at WWDC will be a network of their own servers to offload some of the compute from iPhones for more intensive AI tasks. Apple predictably is doing this in house and has the advantage of using their own silicon. However, this proves that local devices arent necessarily powerful (RAM is the limiting factor) to run large models we use today.

Cloudflares edge network is beneficial in data governance/localization use cases as well. Some progressive governments have introduced data collection and privacy laws. In the EU there is GDPR, regulations that give users more control over their data. One trend developing is that nations are requiring data of their citizens to stay within their borders. This is a very costly problem to solve for many of the public clouds today (even Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). They would have to spend a lot of money to reconfigure how their data centers are set up and create new software to handle how that data is routed.

The last market expansion avenue Id like to highlight is Cloudflare Workers. Workers is a framework used to program Cloudflares edge network. There are many use cases for Workers and Cloudflare does not use it in its total addressable market estimates since it is so hard to estimate. One use case mentioned during Cloudflares investor day was Meta using it for WhatsApp. Each WhatsApp message is injected with some information used for authenticating the message by a Cloudflare Worker. This happens for billions of messages per day and really demonstrates its scale and versatility. I imagine Workers will be a huge driver of revenue at some point in the near future.

Workers AI was recently launched and seems like a very easy way for developers to build apps and connect services to Cloudflares network. I will be monitoring this and seeing if there are new apps launching that use this and would love to see the developer community explode here.

Valuation:

Cloudflares products strategically complement each other and are economically attractive because of the upfront financial and technical decisions that were made when the company was founded. 

Cloudflare benefits from a zero/low marginal cost structure that technology companies often benefit from. The high fixed cost investments (building servers and laying fiber optic cables to create the network) are slowly depreciated over time through the income statement and appear in the form of capital expenditures on the cash flow statement. The network also benefits from being incredibly efficient and operates at a high utilization rate where traffic is routed optimally. 

The company generates over 1.4B in ARR and is growing at around 30%. It operates at north of 75% gross margins and is slightly free cash flow positive, but some amount of shares are being issued to fund employee stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense is the unfortunate reality at most technology companies and many try to falsely claim profitability with adjusted figures where that cost is excluded.

On to the balance sheet, where there isnt a ton of capital in this business at only about ~2B. There is only about 700M worth of equity (assets - liabilities), meaning it trades at a massive premium at 35x equity. With a stock like this youre betting on very high revenue growth and the ability to earn an incredibly high return on invested capital and equity. Although there is network capex (about 10-12% of revenues), Cloudflare is still very asset light and its servers seem to be easily upgradable with minimal additional investment. As mentioned earlier, the foresight to equip every data center with the same hardware and even leaving a slot for GPUs really illustrates this point. The asset light model is advantageous because inflation always eats away earnings growth. If you need to keep putting up a lot of capital to simply operate your business youre really fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, given Cloudflares mission critical offerings of security, speed, and reliability, there is potential of eventual pricing power in my view. The consistent addition of new products and services also increase the value proposition and enables future price increases.

Despite all that, it is still very difficult to value this company because it implies the analyst can predict the earnings potential of the limited amount of capital that exists in the business. There is a lot of so called economic goodwill (not traditional accounting goodwill) in this business and it demands a price that is far in excess of what is measurable. However, given the cost structure, total addressable market, efficiency of the network, and strategic vision, I believe the revenue growth can be above 20% for the next 5 or so years and the company can achieve high levels of profitability. Serving an additional customer is not very costly and reaching greater scale results in greater profitability. In regards to competition, I think being the only vendor to offer products across a wide range of business needs is favorable. 

I did a simple DCF model where I attempt to value the company. Most of the value comes in the terminal stage, as this company is reinvesting back into the business to fund its growth ambitions and produces no meaningful cash today. The management team aims to generate $5B in revenue by the year 2026, which may be ambitious. I find it to be worth about $15B in todays dollars and that approximates the price I paid for it. I have added stock based compensation back in the cash flows and also increased the share count. Ive assumed most of the capex will eventually be maintenance capex. Cloudflare has proven with their architectural advantages that growth capex is fairly low. As a result, the net margin could be very similar to the free cash flow margin (lower if you add back SBC in FCF).

Management:

The CEO of Cloudflare is Matthew Prince who owns about 10% of the company. Prince has made brilliant strategic moves as discussed throughout this article and often sees things before they happen. The founding team was inspired by their professor at Harvard Business School, Clayton Christensen. Christensen is credited with one of the most influential business theories of all time: Dispruption Theory. His book, the Innovators Dilemma, discusses how many of the worlds largest companies over the course of history have faced an existential crisis leading to their fall from grace. This typically happens because incumbent companies are slow to adopt change. They ignore disruptive technologies that do not meet the needs of their main customers. These technologies improve over time and eventually overtake the existing technologies and its too late by the time incumbents adjust.
In Christensens terms, Cloudflare started as a classic low end disruption business model. They captured a large market share in networking and security products by offering their products for free. Now they are aiming to move up market to displace traditional security vendors and find a niche to coexist in the cloud infrastructure market dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. 

Concluding Thoughts: 

Cloudflare is a promising company that trades at an expensive price. I believe it is one of the few technology companies that can grow into its premium valuation over time and it remains one of my highest conviction companies. There is always risk and uncertainty when the companys value primarily stems from its terminal cash flows (and is also the only company in my portfolio with such an extreme setup). However, I am comfortable taking a risk on Cloudflare and anticipate it will be a very successful business.",wallstreetbets,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dg19ef/dd_cloudflare/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9476507306098938

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*By the end of this year, were going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.

2024-01-18,1705612380.0,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments.

2024-06-06,1717699889.0,My Analysis on ARM Holdings. 2 Trillion+ Valuation ,"I believe ARM Holdings is slept on! I believe it could be the next NVIDIA. As of this writing its Market Cap is sitting at $142.36 Billion. I believe that its market cap should be ATLEAST 1 trillion due to the fact that it has an enormous market share of damn near if not more of 95% of the worlds smart device chips. 

What makes ARM unique is its business model. Their primary source of revenue is from the leasing of the design of the instruction set of computer chips. For those who dont know the instruction set is often referred to as an instruction set architecture (ISA), is a group of commands for a CPU in machine language. These commands tell the processor what operations to perform. Each instruction in the set specifies a particular operation to be performed on a specified set of data operands. The instruction set is fundamental to the design and functionality of computer chips, dictating how software communicates with hardware... 

So what is unique about this? Well I will tell you, these instruction sets are incredibly energy effecient compared to what is used currently for AI such as RISC or X86 etc. Currently NVIDIA is soaring because of the AI craze and its success has put light onto AMD, INTEL, SMCI etc but I believe ARM is a sleeper in my opinion. Their main source on revenue is through the royalties it recieves for leasing its designs. They can easily raise the royalty rate to increase their revenue stream anytime but there are some downsides. There customers could leave them and use other options. I dont think that is going to happen because lets face it their intellectual property is far better than any of the competition in terms of effeciency. 

AI is growing rapidly and one key expense is going to be energy consumption. Especially in these data centers. To my knowledge most data centers run on chips that use x86 from Intel. Those chips using that instruction set uses alot of energy. I believe data centers are looking to convert to a more energy effecient chip and when they do.... ENTER: ARM. 

Arm is currently used in almost all smart devices because again they are energy effecient. Why do we have longer battery life in a smart phones? Its because of ARM. What chips do electric cars use? ARM what instruction set does your microwave, fridge, washing machine use? ARM. Currently ARM is all over the portable device market but once they hit the data centers I believe there revenue is going to explode and therefore the market cap. There are major catalysts going down right now such as Microsoft partnering with them to make ARM based laptops and NVIDIA collaborating with them to make computers, not to mention that Tesla ordered a ton of NVIDIA chips that use ARM architecture. 

But my most bullish thing about ARM is what Jensen Huang said at Computex. He said that AI will eventually become physical in terms of robotics. Do you think those robotics need a energy sucker of a computerchip instruction set? No, the need the most energy effecient tech in todays age and that where ARM steps up right again. Currently we only use AI remotely (Chat GPT, Picture Generators, Etc.) but once we put AI into something physical and tangible such as robots to do everyday tasks those devices and robots need to run on the most advance and effecient software. 

I am currently looking at an outlook of 5-15 years and I am long on my position is this stock. We all seen what nvidia did and can only imagine what the next stock can yield the same returns and I think its ARM Holdings. Imagine going back to 2017 and investing into NVIDIA when the markect cap was the same as ARM now. Those returns look nice right if you have invested then. The time is now. Please keep in mind that i have not decided to go completely in depth of all of my research on ARM Holdings so please do your own. Also, I purposefully did not go into fundementals such as earnings and revenue on this. This is just my personal long term outlook on the research I have done.

Ive been in the industry for a while now, and I can confidently say that UiPath ($PATH) is one of the most promising companies in the automation space. Heres why Im extremely bullish on their foundation, and why Im buying in at all-time lows:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**:
   UiPath has shown consistent financial growth. According to a recent article by The Motley Fool, ""UiPath reported revenues of $243.4 million in Q1 2024, a 21% year-over-year increase, showcasing their strong market presence and growth potential"" ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/01/why-uipath-stock-skyrocketed/)). This kind of performance in the current market speaks volumes about their stability and potential for future gains.

2. **Industry Leadership**:
   UiPath is recognized as a leader in the automation industry. Forbes recently highlighted that ""UiPath's innovative approach to automation and their ability to integrate AI into their RPA solutions positions them ahead of the competition"" ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/05/20/uipath-the-future-of-automation/)). Their continuous innovation ensures they remain at the forefront of the industry.

3. **Strategic Partnerships**:
   The company has formed strategic partnerships that strengthen its market position. According to a TechCrunch article, ""UiPaths recent collaboration with Microsoft to integrate their automation solutions with Azure highlights their strategic approach to expanding their ecosystem and driving growth"" ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/uipath-partners-with-microsoft/)). This partnership is set to open new avenues for market penetration and revenue streams.

4. **Robust Customer Base**:
   UiPath boasts a robust and growing customer base. A recent CNBC report mentioned that ""UiPath now serves over 10,000 customers, including many Fortune 500 companies, which underscores their reliability and market trust"" ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/uipath-customer-growth/)). Their ability to attract and retain top-tier clients is a testament to their strong product offering and customer satisfaction.

5. **Market Position and Future Potential**:
   Despite current market fluctuations, I believe UiPath is positioned for significant future gains. As reported by My boy Alpha, ""UiPaths current stock price represents an attractive entry point for long-term investors. With their strong foundation and growth strategy, they are set to capitalize on the growing demand for automation"" Buying in at these all-time lows could lead to substantial returns as the market recovers and their strategic initiatives bear fruit.

My Position: currently 4,000 shares AVG $23.07 currently down $40,000 butttttt buying more and were coming back. 

---

TL;DR -- Ive been in the industry and am extremely bullish on UiPath ($PATH). Strong financials, industry leadership, strategic partnerships, and a robust customer base make it a great buy at all-time lows.

2024-06-14,1718354826.0,You don't understand AI hype,"I have been a lurker on WSB for some time *(ignore the account age)*, despite my lack of activity, and Ive noticed a recent uptick in posts discussing AI hype and how its surely a bubble ready to pop. This is obviously due in large part to the recent NVDA explosion, but theres more to consider.

While you guys spend most of your time focused on the money and investments side of AI, I spend my time focused on the technology itself  and the beliefs that seem to emanate from it.

Lets look at NVDA. Right now, NVDA is making its mark on the world almost entirely due to its ability to produce and supply cutting edge GPUs for companies looking to fashion larger and larger clusters and have more compute than any reasonable person could possibly fathom. Surely, this ends at some point, right? Surely, the people in charge realize that theyve built large enough GPU clusters *(never mind the hundreds of billions recently committed to building the largest datacenters on the planet by the likes of Google and Microsoft)* and Jensen stops getting orders. Surely, this ends.

A lot of people have been comparing AI hype to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s, which seems to be a fair comparison on a surface level. However, this misses something so fundamentally different about AI today that it almost entirely invalidates it.

Whether you think AI is real or a scam or a stochastic parrot or whatever, the people in charge *(Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, etc)* believe 100% that this is one of the final pieces of technology mankind will ever create. They believe that the first company that creates AGI *(artificial general intelligence  typically defined as an AI that can do any task as well as the average person)* will be the first company to create ASI *(artificial superintelligence  typically defined as an AI that is smarter than every single living human being put together)* and will end up deciding the future. And they believe this is going to happen in ten to fifteen years.

If this seems silly to you, I dont blame you. Technology typically doesnt move especially fast or change too much over short amounts of time. Its not like a refrigerator purchased today is a wildly different beast than one purchased fifty years ago. Sure, it might be more efficient and have more room, but fundamentally its the same technology.

This is how life has been ever since the industrial revolution: a new technology is invented, distributed, and then refined over the next 50 years until it basically asymptotes.

That is not what is happening with AI, and it isnt what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go ""Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!""

Whether you like it, believe it, or even choose to acknowledge it, AI isnt in a hype bubble this time. Its easy enough to look back at the last half-century and see AIs previous bubble bursts, but those were due in large part to the technology itself being substandard. Its hard to make ASI when your supercomputer has less computing power than the first iPhone in 2007. This is why todays companies are pouring what seems like an unreasonable and unjustifiable amount of money into buying GPUs  and why they will continue to. Everyone has realized that compute is all you need.

Whether or not this ends up making god in a box isnt especially important. What is important is that the companies trying to do it arent going to stop anytime soon. The risk/reward on trying to build the final thing mankind will ever build is so astronomically skewed that its hardly even a consideration. The reward for success is so vast that it makes the cost of failure *(a few hundred billion dollars)* seem insignificant.

Im not trying to sell you on NVDA or MSFT or anything like that, Im just trying to let you know whats actually going on. You cant sit there and say I looked on the internet and saw a tech bubble from before I was born, that must mean this is the same thing! because that makes you wrong. You fundamentally misunderstand whats happening in tech right now if you think this is going to follow conventional patterns.

2024-06-14,1718373946.0,You Understand AI Hype,"This is in response to the post about how major companies believe they may be building ASI (or the first step to ASI). ETA: since many people seem to be confused, heres the post Im referencing https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/KVzDaNWfW7

There is an obscene, inordinate amount of hype about AI online (and, unfortunately, in person in the case of some of my friends). Lets be clear: the talk of building the last thing humans will create, creating the next step in evolution, etc& *is not coming from the people making large business decisions.* 

That talk is coming from a very online, very insane, very fringe, very self-obsessed group of people who are either convinced AI is going to save us or kill us all. Most sensible people who dont get their news from Twitter (sorry, X) dont believe that chatGPT will make humans obsolete and/or extinct. 

What they _do_ recognize is that LLMs are going to be an important tool to augment (not replace!) human intelligence, and that they will become more commonplace and widespread over the next 3-10 decades. This is why Microsoft has not 1, but 2 products called copilot. You dont name your AI product copilot if you plan on it taking over the world in 5 years. 

To be clear: will we create ASI in the next 5 years? *No one knows and anyone who tells you otherwise is presupposing facts and intelligence structures that are entirely theoretical.*

Is $NVDA a bubble? Well, its profit is growing at triple digit rates, so it doesnt seem to be, unless demand for their products collapses. No one knows if/when that will happen. 

If you feel like youre lost because everyone around you is talking about how AI will control every facet of our lives, but you dont feel that way, take a deep breath. This is not the majority opinion. Big tech CEOs do not believe this. The only people who believe this are eggheads and nerds. 

We dont even know if you can create human level intelligence with digital systems; for all we know it may require analog computers, we simply have no idea. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either trying to sell you something or needs to go outside and touch grass. 

Position: $200K+ in student loans

Tl;dr: big tech CEOs dont actually believe the Artificial Super Intelligence is coming hype, thats coming from a bunch of very online nerds who need to touch grass, the CEOs are just trying to make money

ETA: since people seem to think Im bearish on AI - thats not at all what Im saying. I expect LLMs/AI to be used heavily in business, and Im sure theres billions to be made. Im responding to the idea that big tech CEOs are plowing hundreds of billions of dollars into A100 chips in order to build some moonshot artificial super intelligence which will usher us into paradise. Theyre buying A100 chips so they can make highly profitable models to serve the business customers.

2024-04-04,1712265081.0,AMD - don't buy the dip,"NOTE: while the commentary below stands and I expect AMD to underperform the market, given the strong jobs report, I do not recommend shorting AMD.  I believe AMD will underperform the market which has room to run, but there are better players. 

AMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation ""something"" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

2024-07-23,1721739420.0,CRWD is going to die.,"Im sure you all saw that video of the microsoft dev telling us why the bug happened. If you havent, Crowdstrike is a virus/malware security company that packaged their program as a ""driver"", so they have access to the kernel. On top of that its a bootable driver, so it loads as soon as you turn on the computer. I cant speak for all drivers, but at least in the case of NVDA driver updates to graphics cards, they have to go through Microsoft testing, which is done by Microsoft to determine it is functional and doesnt cause any issues before providing a certificate to let that driver be published. 

As for Crowdstrike, being the incredibly fast and up to the minute protection, they dont have time to do a certificate test to get an approval from microsoft, so they change 1 text file, and push it to all of the machines using their driver. Well on friday, we all saw that driver failed to boot due to an error in the text file. I believe it was a file full of 0's?

Blame the EU for allowing Kernel access in the first place, as they didnt want MSFT to have a monopoly on a virus protector. 

What could very well happen in the long term is Crowdstrike will get their kernel access removed, or be required to update their certificate every time they have an update. **Getting their kernel access removed, would make the an average run of the mill virus scanner, and if they are required to update their certificate every time, they would then be behind the ball in terms of protection as a threat would potentially have days/weeks to infiltrate before Crowdstrike gets to update.** 

In the short term, I also believe customers will break their contracts and move to competitors. Lawsuits will also happen for all the loss of business, as negligence isnt covered under insurance.

I have read more books than last time, I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and I have a greater understanding of quadrants and business money lets begin.

I believe we must short The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC). Let me say thirdly, I am not a financial adviser I cannot advise you. Okay lets begin. Some need to know information to begin. The Kraft Heinz Company produces many products, the most important to the world is mustard. This is quite the coincidence because in 2 days on August 3rd international mustard day will take place. This is not a coincidence. This is an opportunity. My plan is to buy short positions onto craft tomorrow on the 2nd than wait until the 4th when the stock will shoot down in value and then sell right after international mustard day on the 3rd.

Lets talk about this in 3 parts. The fundamentals like the money. The observationals like the stuff you see. Thirdly, the investor sentience. Lets talk financial papers. A market cap of 43.986B. Thats kind of low for the amount of table products they produce. Mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, the list goes on. Any table product you see is made by them. I personally have a market cap goal of 200B they should be valued like Microsoft. They are the Microsoft of customary dressings. Lets talk Observationals. When I say this is the worst company ever I mean it. They produce everything you apply to your food during dinner yet they somehow manage to not have a physical location? Even Apple has physical locations. If they want to start making real money the Heinz Kraft group needs to create physical stores to cell there products I dont understand how they expect to get to a 200B market cap without them. Lets reroute. They have no plans to open stores. Bad business leads to bad profits. Short bus incoming! Discussion of investor sentience. How do I check investor sentience? I only know my own sentience and my buddies sentience at best. I have been looking all over the internet for measurements and resources to check sentience but I am out of luck most of the time. I dont even know the CEOs sentience or the workers sentience. These are important things. I get unrelated articles when looking up investor sentience information.

Lets cut the case. KHC goes down my money goes up. I am taking short positions in this company. I am not adviser but do as I say not as I do once said by Kodak. 

TLDR/Summary/Explanation/Conclusion: The goals of the KHC group are not in the right places. No physical locations, to low market cap, no sentience that Im aware of. I am taking short positions tomorrow before international mustard day, holding through, than selling August 4th.

2024-08-02,1722618363.0,INTC 2026 Leap : Bull Case,"**Background**

High-NA EUV lithography represents a significant leap forward in semiconductor manufacturing technology, poised to dominate over traditional EUV systems. This advanced technology employs an increased numerical aperture of 0.55, compared to 0.33 in current EUV systems, enabling the production of even smaller and more intricate features on silicon wafers. The higher numerical aperture allows for sharper imaging and improved resolution, pushing the boundaries of chip manufacturing into the angstrom era.

Intel has *secured a crucial first-mover advantage by acquiring ASML's entire 2024 stock* of High-NA EUV machines. This strategic move includes five to six units, each valued at approximately $370 million, with the first machine already delivered and assembled at Intel's Oregon facility in early 2024. By monopolizing the initial production run of these cutting-edge tools, Intel has positioned itself at the forefront of semiconductor technology advancement. This aggressive acquisition strategy provides Intel with several key advantages:

1. Technological leadership: Intel will be the first to integrate High-NA EUV into its manufacturing processes, potentially leapfrogging competitors in transistor density and chip performance.
2. Process optimization: Early access allows Intel to refine its manufacturing techniques and overcome initial challenges before competitors even receive their machines.
3. Attracting partnerships: Intel's advanced capabilities may draw high-profile customers like Microsoft and potentially Nvidia to its foundry services.
4. Market positioning: This move could help Intel reverse its recent foundry business losses and reclaim its position as a leading semiconductor manufacturer.
5. Ecosystem development: Intel can start building the necessary infrastructure and expertise around High-NA EUV technology, creating a significant barrier to entry for latecomers.

With competitors like Samsung and SK Hynix potentially waiting until the second half of 2025 for their High-NA EUV equipment, Intel has secured a critical time advantage in the race to develop and commercialize next-generation semiconductor technologies. This head start could translate into a substantial competitive edge in the rapidly evolving chip industry, potentially reshaping the semiconductor landscape in Intel's favor.

Intel lost out on this cycle of silicon because TSMC had bought up all the ASML EUV machine 5-7 years ago.

Now, that Intel has secured next generation NA-EUV machines, it's in a much strong position for the next silicon cycle

2024-08-03,1722718509.0,The Bulls Are Delusional,"The bulls are delusional. The fundamental reason why the market has been mostly going straight up in the past year is because the economy, in aggregate, has been doing very well. Data just came out suggesting that this might be coming to an end. This is not just a fart in the wind or a drop because Powell said something with the wrong tone of voice. It's a fundamental catalyst that will actually impact things. If the data is wrong, then sure, we might go up more. However, people that actually manage money will not ignore deteriorating economic data. They will sell stocks in order to try to time the market. If you're dollar cost averaging, then good for you, but the majority of people here (and on wallstreet) are trying to time the markets to speed up the process of making money. And you don't make money by buying a 5% dip after a 40% rally if you believe that a recession might be coming. 

People have been leveraging like crazy and are going through the 5 stages of grief now that the market went against them. Every time that someone complains that they are down on Nvidia, the most upvoted comment under it is ""don't worry bro, just hold because it will be at $180 in 6 months"". Anecdotally, it seems like everyone's uncle and inheritor of money is all-in on AI. For it to go even higher, someone has to be buying at higher prices. It also has to start making some serious money for the companies who are spending tens of billion of dollars on it. So far, Microsoft and Google are struggling to monetize it relative to the expectations that were being priced in. 

We haven't had a recession since 2008. Covid doesn't count. The fed raised rates and the economy didn't give two shits. If the fed lowers rates, why is the economy magically expected to get better immediately? These are serious concerns and if you think buying the ""dip"" right now is a no-brainer move, then you have no brain. We were at all-time highs 3 weeks ago and deteriorating economic data doesn't flip overnight. Neither do the concerns about it. These last couple of weeks have laid out very important information about what the market as a whole cares about and will rally or crash because of. Lots of people seem to be ignoring this and sticking their head in the sand. Good luck.

Edit: From the hundred or so comments that disagree with me, here's a summary of the sentiment. People think that a deteriorating economy is bullish because the fed will cut rates faster. They think the fed and government will pump money into the economy to keep it going and that's bullish. While I don't disagree with that, I also think that this is a poor argument to buy the dip at nearly an all-time high, especially if you're hoping for quick profits. Stocks will eventually go up simply because the value of the dollar will continue to get inflated away, but you can spend years holding the bag and being in the red. People will try to avoid this and sell their stocks to buy at a lower price later on. If a recession actually occurs, there will be lots of selling soon. Also, I'm not necessarily predicting a recession, I'm making a simple observation of the data and how the market has been reacting to it. For a while, the market has been ignoring bad data and rallying on rate-cut optimism. It is now doing the opposite. This is a very important observation if you want to make predictions.

Edit 2: I've read every comment on this post and it's pretty clear that there is a substantial fear of missing out on the next rally. A lot of people are horrified at the idea of sitting out of the market for a while, let alone going short. This makes me more certain that we've topped out for now and that the upside risk is low.

2024-08-05,1722859834.0,Global Asset Bust | Yen Carry Trade Unwind Explainer,"# Background

A yen carry trade is a popular currency trading strategy that involves borrowing money in Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing it in assets or currencies with higher yields. Here are the key aspects of a yen carry trade:

1. Mechanism: Investors borrow yen at Japan's low interest rates and convert it to another currency, typically investing in higher-yielding assets like stocks, bonds, or currencies of countries with higher interest rates.
2. Popularity: The yen has been a favored currency for carry trades because Japan has maintained near-zero interest rates for over two decades to combat deflation.
3. Profitability: The strategy aims to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the target investment country. For example, borrowing at 0.5% in Japan and investing at 4% in the US could yield a 3.5% profit (before accounting for exchange rate fluctuations).
4. Risk: The main risk is exchange rate fluctuations. If the yen strengthens against the investment currency, it can erode or eliminate profits and potentially lead to losses.
5. Market impact: Large-scale yen carry trades can influence global financial markets. When the yen strengthens significantly, investors may rush to unwind their positions, potentially causing volatility in various asset classes, including equities.
6. Historical context: Yen carry trades have been partly blamed for contributing to market instability, such as during the 2008 financial crisis.
7. Current relevance: Recent strengthening of the yen and changes in Bank of Japan policy have led to speculation about the unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially affecting global markets, including US equities.

It's important to note that while yen carry trades can be profitable, they also carry significant risks and can have far-reaching effects on global financial markets.

# Relationship with Big Tech Stocks

The yen carry trade is a sophisticated financial strategy that involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets. This approach has gained popularity due to Japan's long-standing policy of maintaining near-zero interest rates to combat deflation. One common application of this strategy is selling yen to buy U.S. big tech stocks. 

To initiate a yen carry trade, a trader first borrows yen from a Japanese bank. Japan's low interest rates make borrowing yen an attractive option for investors seeking to leverage their investments. Once the yen is borrowed, the next step is to convert it into U.S. dollars. This can be accomplished through a currency exchange service or a forex trading platform. For instance, if a trader borrows 10 million yen at an interest rate of 0.1%, and the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 110 JPY, the trader would exchange the 10 million yen for approximately $90,909.With the U.S. dollars in hand, the trader then invests in U.S. big tech stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft, or Google. These companies are often chosen because they are expected to yield higher returns compared to the cost of borrowing the yen. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States, as well as the potential appreciation of the tech stocks. However, this strategy is not without risks. 

One significant risk is exchange rate fluctuation. If the yen appreciates against the dollar, the trader may incur losses when converting the dollars back to yen to repay the loan. Additionally, there is market risk, as the value of the U.S. tech stocks may decline, leading to potential investment losses. Furthermore, changes in interest rates in Japan or the U.S. can impact the profitability of the carry trade. For example, if U.S. interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing yen may become less attractive, reducing the potential gains from the investment.Recent market conditions have added another layer of complexity to the yen carry trade. The yen has been strengthening, and there are growing concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. This has led to a mass deleveraging, where investors sell assets, including U.S. tech stocks, to cover their losses and repay yen-denominated loans.

# Bank of Japan Raised Interest Rate to the 0.25 on July 31, 2024

[https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/)

# The Yen Carry Trade Unwind

The Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates to 0.25% has triggered a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy that has long influenced global financial markets.  This policy made the yen an attractive currency for carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets abroad, often including U.S. big tech stocks. The profitability of this strategy relies on the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries, as well as the relative stability of exchange rates.

The Bank of Japan's move to raise interest rates, although still low by global standards, signals a shift towards normalizing monetary policy. This change has profound implications for the yen carry trade. As the interest rate differential narrows, the profitability of the carry trade diminishes, prompting investors to unwind their positions.The unwinding process typically involves selling the assets purchased with borrowed yen and converting the proceeds back to yen to repay the loans. In the context of U.S. big tech stocks, which have been a favored destination for carry trade investments, this means large-scale selling of these equities. 

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, home to many of these big tech stocks, often experiences heightened volatility during such periods.The impact of this unwinding extends beyond just the stock market. As investors rush to close their positions, demand for yen increases, causing the currency to appreciate. This appreciation further accelerates the unwinding process, as it makes the carry trade even less profitable and potentially leads to losses for those who don't exit their positions quickly enough.The ripple effects of this unwinding can be felt across global financial markets. As large volumes of U.S. tech stocks are sold, it can lead to broader market selloffs. 

# Forced Selling

The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 0.25% has led to a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow yen at low-interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets. This unwinding is driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and substantial price drawdowns in the assets being sold off, particularly U.S. big tech stocks.

.The yen carry trade relies on the stability or depreciation of the yen and low-interest rates in Japan. Investors borrow yen at minimal costs, convert it to U.S. dollars, and invest in assets like U.S. big tech stocks, which offer higher returns. However, the recent appreciation of the yen and the narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. have made this strategy less profitable. As the yen strengthens, the cost of repaying yen-denominated loans increases, eroding the gains from investments in higher-yielding assets .The depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar has exacerbated the situation.

 When the yen appreciates, investors who borrowed in yen face higher costs when converting their returns back to yen to repay their loans. This scenario forces investors to unwind their positions to avoid mounting losses. The process of unwinding involves selling off the assets purchased with borrowed yen, such as U.S. big tech stocks, and converting the proceeds back to yen. This forced selling creates downward pressure on the prices of these assets, leading to significant price drawdowns.The large price drawdowns in U.S. big tech stocks are a direct consequence of this forced selling. As investors rush to liquidate their positions, the increased supply of stocks on the market drives prices down. This selloff is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying fundamentals of these companies but rather a reaction to the changing dynamics of the yen carry trade. 

The sharp declines in stock prices can trigger further selling as investors seek to cut their losses, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of declining asset prices and rising yen value. The broader implications of the yen carry trade unwinding are significant. The forced selling of U.S. big tech stocks can lead to increased volatility in global financial markets. As these stocks are widely held and influential in major indices, their price movements can impact market sentiment and investor behavior across various asset classes. Additionally, the appreciation of the yen can have ripple effects on other currencies and markets, as investors adjust their positions in response to the changing exchange rate environment.

# TLDR;

The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike to 0.25% has triggered a substantial unwinding of the yen carry trade, driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and significant price drawdowns in the assets being sold off. This forced selling has led to increased volatility in U.S. big tech stocks and broader financial markets, highlighting the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the far-reaching consequences of changes in monetary policy.",wallstreetbets,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ekm6al/global_asset_bust_yen_carry_trade_unwind_explainer/,Other,POSITIVE,0.5843065977096558

2024-08-06,1722980167.0,Lumentum (LITE) | Bull Case | Bring AI workload from Edge to Cloud,"# Background

Local LLM/LLM inference can be implemented across a spectrum from fully local on a personal computer to fully remote in a data center. Here's an overview of the key approaches:

Fully local inference involves running the entire LLM on the user's personal computer or device. This typically requires specialized hardware like a powerful GPU to achieve reasonable performance, especially for larger models.  The main advantages are privacy, low latency, and no need for an internet connection. However, local inference is limited by the computational resources of the device.

Local inference processing combined with cloud-based training offers a powerful hybrid approach for machine learning applications. In this model, inference is performed on edge devices or local servers, close to where data is generated, while training occurs in the cloud using aggregated data from multiple sources.

Local inference provides several key advantages. It reduces latency by processing data on-device, enabling real-time or near-real-time results crucial for applications like industrial control systems or autonomous vehicles. This approach also enhances privacy and security by keeping sensitive data local, addressing concerns in fields such as healthcare or finance. Additionally, local inference allows for offline operation, ensuring continuity even without internet connectivity.

***While inference happens locally, the system periodically sends data to the cloud for model training and updates. Cloud resources provide the necessary computational power to train large, complex models on extensive datasets aggregated from numerous edge devices. This centralized training allows for continuous improvement of the models based on real-world data from diverse sources, enhancing accuracy and adaptability over time.***

Implementing this hybrid approach comes with challenges. Data synchronization between local devices and the cloud must be carefully managed to ensure local models stay up-to-date. Resource management on edge devices is crucial, balancing computational resources between inference tasks and data preparation for cloud training. Network bandwidth considerations are also important, especially in environments with limited connectivity.

# Fiber Optic For the Increase Workload From Edge To AI Data Centers

Fiber optic technology is essential for transmitting the increased workload associated with local LLM inference and cloud-based training due to its superior bandwidth, speed, and reliability. As local devices perform inference tasks and periodically send large volumes of data to the cloud for model training and updates, traditional copper-based networks would struggle to handle the data throughput efficiently.

The hybrid approach of local inference and cloud-based training generates substantial network traffic. Edge devices continuously collect and process data locally, while also needing to transmit aggregated datasets to cloud data centers for model refinement. This two-way communication requires a robust, high-capacity network infrastructure that can handle large data transfers without introducing significant latency or bottlenecks.

Fiber optics offers several advantages that make it ideal for this scenario. Its ability to transmit data using light signals allows for much higher bandwidth compared to traditional copper cables. This increased capacity is crucial for sending large datasets, updated models, and real-time information between edge devices and cloud servers. The low latency of fiber optic networks also supports the near real-time requirements of many AI applications, ensuring that data can be quickly transferred for timely model updates and inference results.

Moreover, fiber optic networks are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference and signal degradation over long distances. This reliability is particularly important when connecting geographically dispersed edge devices to centralized cloud data centers. The improved signal quality and consistency of fiber optics help maintain data integrity during transmission, which is critical for accurate model training and inference.

As AI models become more complex and data volumes continue to grow, the demand for network resources will only increase. Fiber optic infrastructure provides the scalability needed to accommodate this growth, allowing organizations to expand their AI capabilities without being constrained by network limitations. This scalability is essential for supporting the continuous improvement of models based on real-world data from diverse sources, as mentioned in the hybrid approach.

In summary, fiber optic technology is crucial for supporting the data-intensive nature of local LLM inference and cloud-based training. Its high bandwidth, low latency, reliability, and scalability make it the ideal choice for transmitting the increased workload associated with this hybrid AI approach, enabling efficient data synchronization, model updates, and overall system performance.

SF is struggling to really show value with Data Cloud, their current flagship product. And by the way, commerce has been on a steady downtrend for quite some time as many customers leave for Shopify and other cheaper/more innovative alternatives.

Personally I think that GenAI will make it easier for brands to bring their favorite pieces of tech stacks, which makes it really hard for SF to compete given their focus on owning the entire enterprise end to end.

2024-08-01,1722525103.0, COUR to the moon? Why Coursera is primed for liftoff ===,"EDIT: Some of you might be thinking, ""Isn't Coursera just another Udemy?"" WRONG. Here's why Coursera is playing 4D chess while Udemy is still figuring out checkers:

1. Premium partnerships: Coursera's got the Ivy League and Big Tech backing them. We're talking Google, Stanford, IBM, Imperial College London. Udemy? It's the wild west - anyone can upload a course.

2. Degree programs: Coursera offers legit bachelor's and master's degrees from real universities. Try getting a degree from Udemy (spoiler: you can't).

3. Enterprise focus: Coursera's got 1,511 paid enterprise customers, including Fortune 500 companies and governments. They're not just selling to broke college students.

4. AI innovation: Coursera's going all-in on AI. They've got 2 million enrollments in AI courses, AI-powered features like Coursera Coach, and are pumping out new AI content with top partners.

5. Academic credibility: Coursera's the first online learning platform to get the American Council on Education's seal of approval. That means their stuff can count for real college credit.

6. Revenue model: Coursera's got a diversified revenue stream - Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees. Udemy's mostly relying on individual course sales.

7. Growth trajectory: Coursera's showing solid growth across all segments. Udemy? Not so much.

Don't get me wrong, Udemy has its place. But if you're betting on the future of education, Coursera's playing in a whole different league. It's like comparing a bootleg DVD to Netflix. 

Tldr; Coursera = big brain. Udemy = smooth brain.

Listen up, smooth brains. While you've been YOLOing on meme stocks, a real opportunity has been brewing. I'm talking about Coursera (COUR). Yeah, the online education company. Boring, right? WRONG. This thing is a sleeping giant about to wake up. Here's why:

1. Crushing the numbers: Q2 revenue up 11% YoY to $170.3M. Consumer revenue up 12%, Enterprise up 8%, Degrees up 14%. They're growing across all segments.
2. AI hype train: Over 2 MILLION enrollments in their generative AI courses. Everyone and their mother wants to learn AI right now.
3. Big name partnerships: Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft all launching new certificates on Coursera. These are the heavy hitters.
4. International expansion: Added 7M new registered learners in Q2, now at 155M total. Huge global TAM.
5. Improving margins: Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4M (6.1% margin) vs -$2.9M (-1.9%) last year. They're scaling efficiently.
6. Strong balance sheet: $709M cash, no debt. Plenty of ammo for growth.
7. Undervalued: Trading at \~2.5x forward revenue. Compare that to other high-growth SaaS companies trading at 10x+.

The market is sleeping on this, but it won't last. As the AI hype continues and more people look to upskill, Coursera is positioned perfectly. Analysts have price targets up to $30. We could easily see 100%+ upside from here.

This isn't financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD. But in my smooth-brained opinion, COUR is ready for launch ===

# Management Confidence in the Stock:

* It's a dividend machine, yielding more than 6% across its history. But it also paid several special dividends. End of 2023 the board declared regular quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share; authorized $50 million annual share repurchase plan that it can utilise at anytime (The company has $34m still available at quarter end).

Fundamentals:

* Market cap is currently &lt;=.4x revenue (valuation low compared to peers trading at 1.3-2.3x); revenue is also potentially going to increase given recent acquisitions.
* **Assets under management totaled $25.8 billion** at the end of March with a market cap of just $930.07M

2024-08-22,1724354029.0,"16 years old, looking for help!","Hello guys,

I'm from Germany, and we start something like an apprenticeship for 3 years at the age of 16. You work 40h a week though you alternate between work and a school meant to combine theory and practice and prepare you for an actual job in the field you did the apprenticeship in.

My employer offers capital accumulation benefits of 40¬/$44 a month. I've decided to put this,essentially,free money into an investment fund. As I am gonna be working in the banking industry,I don't gave to pay any additional fees to a investment fund including a stock depot,if that's the right word. I am using the UniGlobal offer.

Over the course of at least 6 years,these 40 euros go to the fund,which picks and buys stocks of different branches,something like ETFs. Right now, 70% of all stocks bought come from the IT branch, so from companies like Apple,Amazon,NVIDIA etc.

What stocks are bought are influenced by worldly events,so during the covid epidemic,mostly Medical and Pharmaceutical stocks were getting bought. 

After 6 years of paying in, I can freely access the depot and do whatever I want with the money. I can keep putting money in or sell everything off,though I will probably do the former.

My question is if you guys think that this is a good choice, as my only other 2 options were putting the money into a retirement account/fund or a savings contract. There is obviously risk involved but i am confident in it working out for the better. I ak still pretty young and would appreciate others' opinions on this.

2024-07-31,1722450465.0,Why I'm playing META calls today,"Hey guys, I'm the dude who told you guys to buy [TSLA puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) for earnings right before the stock tanked. Those who read my post made major gains. Now I wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think META will do well with their earnings today.

I think the stock is undervalued. A lot of people think of ""facebook"" when they look at the stock. The company is seriously a far cry from the simple website it was at the beginning. Today, the company owns a family of apps that mediate social interaction for billions of people worldwide.

Actually tho, give it some thought. When was the last time you posted to Instagram? How about the last time you messaged someone on WhatsApp? Bought something on Facebook Marketplace? Meta is part of daily life for much of the world, and that makes it very valuable. It recently surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization and is now the seventh-largest company in the world.

The company achieved this after its stock soared more than 43% since this time last year. Now that's a big move, but I think it could go much further. Despite this run-up, Meta is still undervalued. With the company gearing up to release Q2 earnings today, I'm let's consider calls. 

**Meta products reach a staggering amount of people across the globe**

Every day, 3.24 billion people worldwide use Meta products. It owns the first-, third-, fourth-, and seventh-most-popular social media platforms in the world, reaching the most people of any social media company.

Yes, younger users are migrating away from Facebook, but about 43% of its users are between 18 and 34. And Meta has Instagram, which remains very popular with younger users.

The company is growing its user base steadily. The first quarter Q1 saw a 7% bump year over year. Please pay attention to this metric today. I know I will be. 

**Meta's billions of eyeballs mean billions of dollars for the bottom line**

All these users make Meta's virtual real estate extremely valuable. That's good news for the company; it makes 99% of its revenue from selling ads, and the company has been growing its bottom line at a strong clip for some time now. Look at this growth over the last five years.

Growth leveled off for a moment in 2022, a tough year for tech across the board, but it's back in high gear. Last quarter, the company reported a 27% jump in revenue from a year ago, largely stemming from the 20% jump in ad impressions, which were 6% more expensive compared to the same period in 2023. Consensus estimates put Q2 revenue growth at just shy of 26%. Let's see Meta delivers.

**Meta's AI story is just taking flight**

Much of the focus of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom for the last year and a half has been on Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but Meta is back in the spotlight after the release of Meta AI, an AI product that is integrated across its family of apps. Mark Zuckerberg believes the chatbot will be the most widely used in the world by the end of the year. Now, CEOs are always making bold claims, but Meta AI will be freely available and integrated into the apps that 3.24 billion people use every day, so I wouldn't be surprised if his claim holds up.

Powering Meta AI is the company's large language model (LLM). This thing is called Llama for some reason. The newest version (3.1), just came out and with it, the company makes a bold move. Llama is open source!! Meaning people from all over the world can contribute to its growth and development, which is crazy. The other major players, like ChatGPT, are proprietary. Only employees can interact with the backend. Zuckerberg is making a bet that the collective knowledge of the public can help Llama outpace its rivals. It's a risky bet, but one that could pay off and that makes Meta stand out from the crowd.

**Despite all it has going for it, its stock is still cheap**

If all that weren't enough, Meta's stock is one of the cheapest in tech, its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 23. Now look, compared to its competitors:

* NVDA: 41

* AMZN: 40

* AAPL: 33

* GOOG: 22

he only company valued lower is Alphabet, and only by a hair. If you also consider its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a valuation metric that divides P/E by its expected growth rate -- Meta looks even better. Alphabet has a five-year forward PEG of 1.24, while Meta's is just 1.07. There are, of course, other ways to look at valuation, but in my eyes, Meta looks like a great deal at the moment.

And for this reason, I'm getting calls. RIGHT before earnings. Like with TSLA, the cons are just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so I'll be getting a call spread. Buying the 8/2 500c while selling the 525c (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 515 bucks right now at the time of writing.

2024-08-19,1724039733.0,PLTR &amp; SPY - A distorted   mirror ,"Analyst believe we might be entering a bull market similar to the 1994 - 2000 period, which saw minimal retracement. This era began with the bond market crisis and sudden interest rate hikes by Japanese banks, followed by actions from the Federal Reserve that fueled the bull cycle. During this time, many companies and investors achieved substantial gains, with Microsoft increasing over 1000% from 1995 to 1999, a period when Warren Buffett also saw significant profits. Coincidently there was a World Cup in 94 in the US, the most profitable ever, its fun to know  26 is fast approaching.  


For the bears - hang in there if you are patient for informative content this post has its bull and short term bear case 

Basically - the printer was busy, and as good old Ray Dalio would say - since one mans debt is another mans asset, when money is being printed, buy assets.

History doesnt quite repeat itself exactly , but often mirrors, and almost replicates 
  
Today ; 

We might be witnessing American economic exceptionalism.

At a rate of 10,000 per month of retirement, baby boomers are leaving open a wide gap in the job market for young people to inherit. Therefore the prospects of jobs is looking good while interest rates are likely to drop very soon. Yes we know the so called 4th Industrial Revolution and GDP growth for 2025 . Also  even if GDP  slows for Q3 it will be picking very good later in Q4 for a slightly  better mid 2025 ( analyst predictions ) 


So how will capitalize on the future ? 
- we know they delivered on each Q numbers 
- We know they are part of what some consider the 4th Industrial Revolution ( AI ) 
- We know the balance sheet is clean while growth is nearly certain 

Now let me explain your the double edge sword with a twist. This sword has two edges, while one is extremely sharp ( the bull  case ) the other side  although less sharp is still very hurtful 

Note : *The bull case is not about the numbers, if you want the numbers go look them up . And NO I dont mean the stock price , I mean the balance sheet and projected growth, if they delivered on promises and what is the future of the market they are in and if they even have competition .*

**THE BULL CASE**

*THE EMPIRE WILL SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SUSTAIN ITS HEGEMONY*

To sustain an empire, significant investment is required. Alex Karp and Peter Thiel, both staunch capitalists who champion Western values and American exceptionalism, are key figures in this endeavor. Their interviews reflect their commitment to these principles.

The lack of a viable alternative to capitalism is evident; no other system has lifted more people out of poverty. From fascism to extreme socialism, alternative systems have historically failed. For instance, Maos socialist policies in China caused the deaths of over 20 million people, Stalins communism led to famine and political purges, and fascism has also proved disastrous. Despite its flaws, capitalism and democracy have shown more promise in advancing human progress than any other system.  You could never Im your own mind give me a PROVEN system that has worked better or tested time . Although not perfect and has blood on its hands , it is clearly the lack of better proven alternative. 

With a rapid advancement of China and what some believe it is the peak of the American Empire - we are reminded of this by experts like Ray Dalio . The empire will
Spend whatever to stay at the top . 
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and shifting global dynamics, the U.S. will need to invest heavily in AI to maintain its edge. This necessity underscores Peter Thiels belief in the importance of maintaining technological supremacy. Palantir, with its unique position in AI, faces no direct competition, making it crucial for the U.S. to stay ahead. If the current leaders do not act decisively, rivals like China could surpass them. This advcement converts into proven bootcamps  or experience that develops to its population through enterprise. Papantir was not kidding when they said it would happen faster rather than later. 


**THE BIG BAD BEARS**

This time however, we have few factors that may delay this process in the short term and bring the bears back to their furious glory. 

Here they are in order  

- Middle East ( Escalation energy cost brings inflation  and gold back to glory ) . 
- Eastern Europe ( Escalation energy cost brings inflation  and gold back to glory 
- Natural disaster ( any major would destroy job reports quarterly reports and scale back all earning estimate in which are already high ) 
- China -North Korea - The sleeping Giant is Under estimated . They will never forget the promise of the completion of the mainland. 

All these in which Palantir is involved in . HOWEVER. The stock price going up is not what Alex Karp mean when he said palantir would thrive in bad time . He meant the consistent earnings  

Some think that Palantir benefits in such events -however the opposite is true in the short term .  The start of the russia  Ukraine war and the escalation of the Israeli Iran  conflict saw a dip in the market and palantir was no exception,  it too dropped.  

Palantir will undoubtedly benefit and emerge as likely in a league of its own - Peter Thiel  believes in business that see no competition,  it is undoubted true thar palantir offers to government no one else offers , and for many enterprises they admit the same. 

Given the incredible rise in daily options post pandemic and the game of 0DTE a 20-30% drop in the entire value of PLTR can be wiped. Yes the dip can be repurchased ONLY IF the entire market does not scale back its earnings estimates. The whisper in the streets is  that the estimates are already to high for Q4. The whispers can escalate quickly to loud drum bears on mainstream media  if any of the above factors mentioned escalate. 



Major international conflicts or natural disasters, as well as fluctuations in oil prices, could heavily affect job reports and increase recession fears. Currently, there's a 25% chance of a recession if these risks materialize and negatively impact economic stability. If any of this occurs the risk of recession goes up INCREDIBLY  and overnight indices fall and much like history PALANTIR WOULD FALL 


At a rate of nearly 10,000 retirements, a month, baby boomers are disappearing, and the prospects of acquiring jobs still holds significant confidence among young people. But they also are the most fragile as they carry the burden of debt. If they lose their jobs and cant find another one - they are done for it . 

Incredible volatility ahead in the next year:
The GDP is expected to slow down and Q3and pick up  perhaps later in Q4, and at the beginning of mid 2025 it will enter a period of growth. 

Therefore, the short term risks are very real for the following reasons :

-Palantir was considered over, valued by many analyst, and now is considered extremely. Therefore, if there is any slip and the prophets earning due to any economic international or domestic affairs, Pelletier will get hit hard.

*We thrive in bad Times*- Alex carp

Although  very true he did not mean the stock price,  he meant the company. In fact, look back at history:

At the beginning of the Ukraine, Russia war the entire Market shrunk briefly. 

At the beginning of Israeli Palestinian, conflict, the entire market decreased

At the beginning Iranian involvement the market took a hit . 


PLTR  was no exception. If the entire market decreases palantir will also decrease, especially  if there are no major earnings report or exciting news. since palantir has never been good at marketing, they will never pull a rabbit out of the hat to save the stock price

We NEED BIGGER GPU'S

I want to introduce you to a very BIG GPU

Blackwell - David Blackwell (mathematician, game theorist, probability)

2 largest dies possible.

128 billion transistors

20 peta flops

384 g HBE ram

40 petaflops of AI performance

80 petaflops

80 GB/s bandwidth

36 Grace CPU's

14.4 Tb/s bandwith

NVLINK

GB200 NVL72

Quantum InfiniBand

Liquid Cooling

Jesus this thing is SKYNET itself

GH100 most advanced today - Blackwell is 2x the size physically and will be the most advanced. 208 billion transistors.

Grace Blackwell system - But there is more.

**UPDATE:**

2.5 x FPA for training over G Hopper

FP6 -

FP4 40 flops 5x - important for inference.

Inference is generation - old computing is retrieval of data - this is generating tokens.

Vast majority of content will not be retrieved but rather generated. This is FP4 - and Blackwell is 5x the inference capability.

Seems like enough but why stop there. It's NOT enough.

We NEED A BIGGER GPU.

J Huang is cooking

Blackwell is a BEAST

We still NEED MORE Need another chip

NVLINK Switch Chip

50B Transistors - It doesn't even make sense. Build a system to talk to every GPU and CHIP at the same time - connect over a coherent link - 1 Giant GPU.

DGX GB200 NVL72

1 Giant GPU

Training FP8 720 PFLOPS 22x WTF

Inference FP4 = 45x WTF LOL

Worlds first 1 xoflop machine in 1 rack. Only 2 or 3 on the planet.

The world entire internet in these wires. and it's liquid cooled.

GPU's are 3000 lbs. that's 1.5 TONS. WTF lol My goodness.

The inference capability of Blackwell is 30x greater!

FP4 Tensor core and NVLINK Switch - is the true key to the innovation here. it is communicating 10x faster than the past.

Blackwell is the shit. There is so much Blackwell is going to bring. It's going to bring the AI industrial revolution. Sovereign AI - Telco's everyone is signing up for blackwell.

Jensen Huang is cooking!

**Update:**

Digital Twins with Nvidia's Omniverse DGX Cloud is a really big deal. You can create and build a digital twin world so that you can scale and build faster. Also, it has profound robotics implications.

AGX - SOC - Designed for Robotics

JETSON - This is legit. I work on this.

The virtual world is Omniverse - It is hosted in the Azure Cloud

AI and Omniverse OVX (digital twin) They are giving a platform for

A robotics building / warehouse and there will be some autonomous systems.

This is wild, the NIMS and DGX Cloud you can virtualize a world that you can train your robots and hardware on. it's how you'll test the hardware running their autonomous robotic stack.

You will have to have the digital twins.

Siemens is building the Industrial metaverse.

Nvidia Omniverse Cloud

**Update:**

Autonomous vehicles as a service. THOR for BYD first usage.

Apple getting direct link to tie Apple Vision Pro to Omniverse. So apple to microsoft Azure. lol.

**Update:**

Ended with Robotics, Nims, Jetson, Omniverse Digital AI workloads / Digital Twins. This may become the largest company in the world. This will all be going to robotics. This will be the next industrial revolution.

2024-03-19,1710821181.0,AI missing link,"Lets discuss potential missing link for the AI boom before it spirals into oblivious amount of worldwide adoption and hopefully find a missing link before it kicks off big time because thats direction where  technology is headed.

First of all we need to discuss what could AI potentially mean for our future and what implications it might have.

To my best of knowledge from reading various statements and articles, AI is going to take a big chunk of jobs across all of the sectors.

Logistics

Teslas Cybertruck will have an option of following one another and therefore youll have a fleet of trucks, commandeered by one driver whos first in the convoy, cruising on a highway
Tesla is already mapping all the roads to perfection before the commercial usage of cybertrucks to its fullest.

Automation of factory jobs

Theres activist already actively protesting like were back in 1760 during the start of the industrial revolution.


Healthcare 

An AI doctor is currently learning about (Chatgpt-like software) thats potentially going to make better judgments and diagnosis then the doctors themselves
We still might be a long way down the road from this one, but money is clearly being dumped into projects like these 

Education 

AI softwares will have an ability to recognize students learnings patterns and adapt the learning program to each student individually.
Results have been proven already at staggering 62% grade improvement. 
Not everyone learns the same and thats the problem AI will fix

These are very few of many sectors in which AI will intertwine with our lives and its only the beginning. 

As with all booms in the tech, AI is the logical next step.

For AI to achieve massive adoption it needs computing power, advertisement and ___________?

To break them down

Computing power

If you havent heard about Nvidia, Dell, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing etc.  you must live under a rock
These companies have been under the spotlight for a while now and theyre making record deals and gains.
For example.in 2013 Nvidia sold 1.5mil units of their H100 GPUs to Meta, Microsoft, Google and other companies for 37.5Billion in revenue only from 1 processor(wait times were about 6 months).
Theyre also expecting to ship 2 million of the same GPU in this year.
With currently a supply being shorter then the demand, many companies are on a race to pick up the biggest pie of the cake and that was reflected on their stock prices.
With that being said ,Computing Power was one fragment of AI boom where the money could have been made by us investors( thats if you recognized the opportunity on time) .
Not saying theres no more money to be made in this sector but weve definitely come far, fast. 

The next fragment needed for a massive adoption of AI is advertisement.

Google and Amazon are taking the first spots 
AI is directly used in advertising products across all of the sectors.
Its abilities are reducing the amount of manpower for the job and its is also self advertising by doing so.
These kind of automated tasks will give companies the ability to reduce labour cost which will directly translate into higher revenue.
Massive adoption of AI in advertisement sector is coming sooner then you think. 

For a seed to become a tree it will need water, sunlight,and carbon dioxide.
As we mentioned above, massive AI adoption will need Computing Power, Advertisement and something else to really take over the whole technological sector like a wildfire.
The reason why I believe it needs something else to spark is because its simply not there yet.

Theres been great opportunities to make money in the last year with crypto going parabolic, especially AI projects, plain company stocks that sell/manufacture semi conductors, playing call options on their earnings, holding or playing call options on microstrategy etc.

With all the above being said, Im asking you redditors, what is the missing link? 
If we could figure out where will the next big money flow into, we can be ahead of the game and make some serious money.

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

A fund is essentially a big pot of money that professional investors trade with to make money for everyone. If you add your money into the pot you get to share in the winnings if there are any. 

Mutual funds are actively monitored so theres a little bit of a fee (expense ratio), and ETFs are usually passively managed so the fee is smaller. 

Lets say you have $100 to invest. You could buy one stock in some random company, or could keep saving up until you can afford a popular stock like Apple or something. 

Or instead, you could invest that in a fund. And maybe 10% of your money goes towards Apple, 10% goes towards Amazon etc. 

Its a way for you to diversify without needing tons of money. And you can check the portfolio of any fund and find some that invest in companies or industries you like. 

This way you can just drop your money in one or a handful of funds and never worry about how any specific company is doing because youre diversified!

2024-05-25,1716630199.0,Still Obsessed with Chip Makers (Part 3),"This is my third quarterly post about chip makers. 6 months ago, SMH was around $160. 3 months ago, it was just under $200. Yesterday, it reached $244. I believe chips are still a great investment, even at this price, and I am continuing to buy more.

Along the way, many commenters have argued against chips, so this quarter I think I'd like to address the common themes I see in the comments, and explain why I think chips are still a great opportunity.

1: AI is a gimmick, or has very limited practical use, or is just a fancy auto-complete, and it won't drive growth in chips

This is probably the most common and upvoted argument I see. I have to guess that people making this argument either haven't experimented with AI themselves, or don't yet have a use for AI in their day to day lives.

For me, I use GitHub copilot every day. It is an incredible productivity boost. Developers that have used GitHub copilot understand how much value is there, and the rest of the world is just now catching up with things like Microsoft's recently announced Copilot+ (more on that in a minute). So if you want to argue that AI is a gimmick or fad, I'd ask that you also explain why you think millions of people will suddenly stop or decrease their use, rather than increase and expand their use of AI as it continues to get better.

2: We don't need more chips, soon there will be too much supply

Last time I saw this argument, I countered that even as data centers built up their AI capabilities, on-device demands were going to further strain supply. Since then, there have been several announcements about on-device chips, with Copilot+ (and the requirement of a chip that can do 40 TOPS) perhaps being the biggest and clearest example.

Very few devices today (laptops, phones, etc.) have enough processing power, or the right kind of processing power, to efficiently run a small LLM. Hence, the release of new chips like the M4 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, which were designed specifically to power small on-device LLMs. In my opinion, these chips are going to be a minimum system requirement going forward, and virtually every device will eventually be replaced with one that has one of these new chips.

3: It's a chip bubble, there's no fundamentals supporting the price

I'm a big believer in fundamental analysis, and if you look at chips through the lens of fundamental analysis, I see your point. NVDA is trading at over 60 P/E, and why would you buy that when there are other great companies trading at a much lower P/E.

The thing is, fundamental analysis is great for mature industries that are perhaps innovating on their operations, making them more efficient, but where there is not much actual product innovation. Fundamental analysis really breaks down when you have a rapidly evolving or completely novel product, a product so innovative it creates an all-new industry. For example, if you were thinking about investing in Amazon around 2010, fundamental analysis would have told you that the company is burning through cash, and their P/E ratio was in the high 60's, and that it wasn't a good value. Of course, the stock went on to grow by more than 20x since then. So much for fundamental analysis.

Fundamental analysis really falls short when it comes to new products that are so innovative they create their own industries. The companies creating these products tend to spend heavily on R",investing,54.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d08frq/still_obsessed_with_chip_makers_part_3/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9966228008270264

Wait a minute, there is another strange thing in the tables above. In the latest results, #NVIDIA declares:

* 18.8bn$ of future inventory commitments
* 10.6bn$ of future non-inventory commitments
* TOTAL 29.4bn$

This means that #NVIDIA increased the orders with its suppliers to produce GPUs only by 16.7% while total future commitments increased by 42%. What about inventory orders compared to one year ago? They grew from 7.24bn$ to 18.8bn$ or TWO-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE PERCENT

Wait a minute, by how much did #NVIDIAs Computer and Networking revenues grow over the past year? 404%&

Basically, #NVIDIA pretends us to believe that:

* Its clients purchase in big sizes never asking for a discount (and do not forget \~50% of the total revenues come from just 4 names: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta)
* Its suppliers continue producing at the same costs over the years despite the boom in order

So clearly the laws of demand and supply do not apply to #NVIDIA unless& the company keeps rebates to clients and production costs increases by its suppliers off-the-book to keep showcasing unrealistic margins in the same way they did, and got fined for, in the aftermath of the dotcom bust: [NVIDIA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/is-nvda-currently-employing-the-same-accounting-trick-to-inflate-its-margins-it-was-previously-caught-using-during-the-dot-com-bubble/)

As if the above I described was not already enough, we already know:

* NVIDIA is inflating its sales via client financing. In some very peculiar situations, Nvidia is even a significant shareholder of them, like in the case of Coreweave: [NVIDIA (PONZI) LIES UNDER NVIDIA NOSE](https://justdario.com/2023/11/nvda-ponzi-lies-under-nvda-nose/)
* NVIDIA is gamma-squeezing its own stock: [NVIDIA  THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/nvidia-the-fraud-smoking-gun/)

At this point, I believe there is no more doubt that #NVIDIA is only one piece of a bigger fraudulent puzzle.

1- #NVIDIA invests in [#Coreweave](https://justdario.com/tag/coreweave/)

2- #Coreweave buys (overpriced) #NVIDIA GPUs.

3- #Coreweave raises financing using #NVIDIA GPUs as collateral. What do they do with that? They buy more #NVIDIA GPUs, of course&

4- Meanwhile #Microsoft signs a deal with #Coreweave worth billions for future use of a cloud infrastructure #Coreweave didnt even begin to build yet while #Microsoft is, at the same time, loading on #NVIDIA GPUs for Azure that technically is a #Coreweave competitor?!

2024-08-25,1724607819.0,"The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings","## Why is AI a bubble?

Before any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.

The business case for AI is dead simple: ""Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?"". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like ""just make it work"" and ""do more with less"". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 ""just make it work"" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.

It's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying ""FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green"" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.

And GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.

## Why now?

A ground rule for machine learning is ""exponential investment for linear gains"". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.

* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of ""all words ever written by humans"".
* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).
* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).
* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.

But most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of ""the next version will finally be it, trust me bro"" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.

## Why Nvidia?

Nvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.

The expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.

Nvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.

## Are we in for a broader tech crash?

Personally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.

The real hit in the medium term will be to ""shovel sellers"". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.

* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor.

2024-08-28,1724887395.0,Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.

Here is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected
Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected
Nvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.

Revenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.

Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 

Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.

Revenue in Nvidias data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.

Not all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the companys networking products.

Much of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidias chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Many customers are waiting for Nvidias next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell.

There are over 400 million machines that are effected and unable to update to windows 11.  Intel controls 70 percent of the PC market. The last time Microsoft stop supporting a windows system was with windows 8 and this is where Intel stock holders capitalized. In the first year when Microsoft stop supporting the operating system windows 8, Intel stock rose over 30 percent and within 2 years intel stock rose close to 100 percent. 

With this in mind it's important to reference that In 2016 windows 8 never reached a market share of more than 10 percent.  As of July 2024 windows 10 is the most popular operating system, with a market share of around 65 percent. More people are effected this time around which means more Intel units will be sold.

2024-08-29,1724943680.0,5 reasons Im in nvda short,"Nvidias q2 performance was great but the market was expecting it better because nvidia has been taking over Apples place. Tell you guys why Im against nvidia tho this company is great and I still see the potential for the ai boom
1. Slowing down the growth : 
Like I said the market expects nvdas higher growth. Compared to apple, Microsoft, except for the growth and profit rate, everything else is lower than the other two. 

2. Delay of Blackwell 
Theres a bit of delay of the product. No matter how early or late they can produce it. It just increases uncertainty like Teslas robotaxi day.  

3.  Lower net profit margin
The company still has super high net profit margin but in q2 its a bit lower than last quarter and it will go down next quarter too since tsmc has increased  manufacturing cost. 

4. Buyback 
It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. 

5. Seasonal short month
September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but theres a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? 

This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out! But I succeed to make a profit from nvidia 3x inverse when it hit $140 and also nvidia x3 leverage when It hit $90 lately.

2024-08-29,1724945792.0,Diamondback Energy (FANG) Leaps | $100 Oil Bull Case | Thematic,"# Thematic

The primary factors driving this potential oil price increase include geopolitical tensions, production cuts by major oil-producing countries, and robust global demand.

Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Hamas war, could lead to supply disruptions or fears of disruptions, causing sharp but potentially transitory price spikes. OPEC+ countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Russia, have committed to significant production cuts, which are tightening global supply.

The International Energy Agency has forecast growing world oil demand, driven by resurgent Chinese consumption, which could reach 101.8 million barrels per day by the end of this year. This combination of constrained supply and increasing demand is creating what some analysts call a ""substantial market deficit.""

Additionally, potential supply risks from ***Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries*** could further impact global oil availability. While some experts caution that factors like ample spare capacity in the Middle East and potential demand destruction at higher price levels could help keep prices in check, many analysts and major financial institutions, including Bank of America, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, are now predicting Brent crude prices could reach or exceed $100 per barrel before the end of 2025. However, it's important to note that oil prices are highly volatile and subject to rapid changes based on various economic and geopolitical factors.

2024-08-29,1724958514.0,Why I am short on NVIDIA,"As someone with a background in data science, Ive been working with GPUs for the past 4-5 years, so I have a decent understanding of the space. Here's my thesis on why I'm shorting NVIDIA.

About a year ago, the major tech companies were severely ""GPU poor."" Getting a GPU instance on any cloud server was incredibly difficult. People, including the CTO of Hugging Face, even used the term ""GPU poor"" to describe the situation. However, things have changed.

NVIDIA has fulfilled a significant number of orders, and now, securing a GPU instance on cloud servers is much easier.

Most companies rely on Microsoft, Google, or AWS for their GPU needs. With the ""shovels"" (GPUs) already sold, the opportunity now lies with the ""gold diggers"" (companies using GPUs for innovation). At this point, I struggle to justify NVIDIA's $3.1 trillion market cap. The only way for them to continue standing out with such a high valuation is by innovating something even faster. But, in my opinion, thats unlikely to happen at the pace the market expects.

So, thats my thesis, and I'm ultra-short on NVIDIA now. I've been shorting it since the $100-$120 levels \[before results\], and I believe this position will pay off in the long run.",wallstreetbets,461.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f4ap98/why_i_am_short_on_nvidia/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9918993711471558

The fact that this model requires so much power it has to be limited to 35 messages per week is incredible. I am driving this one point because it is a clear throughput situation. 

Also, the information cutoff is October 2023 which tells me this isn't the new massive model they are releasing. So, what does this all mean? 

It means they released a new capability which uses much more compute but isn't technically perhaps their new monster model that is trained on trillions of parameters. If this was a new model I would expect the cutoff date to be much more recent. At least 3-6 months would have made more sense. Now, there is time between training and cutoff time but I don't think they've been sitting with a model that has been trained for over a year ago. A newer, more recent model must be sitting there for use but can't. 

What this all suggest to me is that they are currently massively GPU constrained at the moment and waiting desperately for Blackwell. What you would expect is massively more throughput for GPT-o1 and you eventually have to expect a newer more massive model that is fundamentally better at the core.

2024-03-20,1710940226.0,"Intel awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act grants, with billions more in loans available","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html

The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday.

The money will help leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States keep America in the drivers seat of innovation, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change.

Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the worlds PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm.

Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwans TSMC for the manufacturing of the device.

TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the worlds fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan.

Thats a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan.

Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026.

Intels Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing.

The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters.

Go drive by the Ohio site, Gelsinger said. There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.

GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

2024-06-25,1719334886.0,Last call for IMAX -- Time to get your popcorn out!,"IMAX is headed for $23.  And if you already missed the 30% run up in CNK the last 3 weeks, fear not, there is still hope.  The summer box office has finally started heating up and I strongly believe IMAX is the next theater stock to benefit from the summer hype cycle.  Inside Out 2 is knocking it out of the park  having already amassed over $750M in less than 2 weeks.  Clearly good movies will put butts in seats  especially when record heat waves are giving people another reason to find indoor options for entertainment this summer, 

So why IMAX you ask?  Because AMC is a disaster financially and you probably already missed the big run up in CNK, Yet IMAX is still trading well below its 52-week highs with a price target of $23  a 35% increase from its current price.  IMAX also has the best patented tech in the industry with a global brand that continues to grow market share in every corner of the world.  IMAX is the Apple of the movie industry.

So why now?  Because movie theater stocks almost always perform well during the summer blockbuster season.  Especially when they start the summer a discounted stock values and particularly when when the biggest action films of the year are just around the corner -- and that's proving itself out once again this year.  And now we are just days away from A Quiet Place Day One opening this weekend  followed by Despicable Me4, Twisters2, and capping the summer blockbuster slate with Deadpool/Wolverine which is expected to delivery a $200M opening weekend.

When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told.

2024-07-01,1719798810.0,Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by years end,"A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which theyve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they dont settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidias stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didnt just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldnt possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidias place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasnt happened and Nvidias only gotten stronger.

Thats not to say over time Nvidia wont lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, its not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I dont think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidias growth story.",wallstreetbets,523.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dshht2/nvidia_just_getting_started_stock_heading_to_150/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9885483980178833

I have been using $LIF since 2020 because my 3 siblings used it and wanted me to share locations with them. It wasn't really on my mind since I didn't trade back then but come to 2023 when I'm in freshman year of college, every person is using it other than find my iPhone for locations. Life360 seems to be the most applicable app for location sharing among families or friends due to it being available on both Android and Apple. When the IPO occurred I talked to my sister who is still in highschool if she likes life360 and she told me she bought the premium subscription for it. Therefore leading me to my bull thesis and deeper due diligence.

**Fundamentals**

The balance sheet if looking back since 2020 seems pretty strong with cash and equivalents being greater than the total debt, therefore meaning won't go bust in the face of economic downturn. The total assets were also increasing since 2020 up to 2023 along with the debt decreasing or coming back to about what is was in 2020 in 2023.

The losses are decreasing yoy, the revenue from both service and hardware is increasing yoy, and therefore the losses are shrinking yoy.

I have discovered while doing my research that LIF owns Tile and Jiobit. Tile seems to be around a lot if you look for them while talking to people. Their brand isn't just the app but also physical products as well which shows they are expanding.

# Why did CCL Stock Rise After Q2 Earnings?

1. Record Financial Performance:

Record Revenues: Carnival reported record second-quarter revenues of $5.8 billion.

Operating Income: Achieved record operating income of $560 million, nearly five times the 2023 levels.

Net Income: Significant improvement in net income, nearly $500 million higher than 2023, with adjusted net income outperforming March guidance by nearly $170 million.

2. Increased Guidance:

Full Year 2024 Guidance Raised: Carnival raised its full-year net yield guidance to approximately 10.25% and increased full-year adjusted net income guidance by approximately $275 million due to continued strong demand.

Positive Outlook for 2025: Early bookings for 2025 were even higher than 2024 in both price and occupancy, indicating strong future demand.

3. Strong Demand and Bookings:

Record Customer Deposits: Customer deposits reached an all-time high of $8.3 billion, surpassing the previous record by $1.1 billion.

High Occupancy and Prices: The cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2024 was the best on record, with occupancy and prices significantly higher than the previous year.

4. Operational Efficiency and Strategic Moves:

Cost Management: Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) were better than prior year and March guidance due to cost savings and timing of expenses.

2024-07-08,1720476629.0,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

You read that right. 395 million. Total 2023 revenue was just 2.6 billion. It has a P/E of 600+. These are shocking numbers for a company with that high of a market cap.

ARM is riding on the AI wave, obviously. Nvidia is on a meteoric rise, and any company that mentions AI sees their stock prices skyrocket. However, ARMs entire business model is royalties. They created the ARM computer chip architecture in 1985, which is far more efficient than Intels x86. ARM architecture is used in almost every mobile device, and lately, many computer chips in laptops and desktops (All of Apples chips use ARM). This all sounds great for ARM, until you realize that they dont design these chips, nor do they build them. They are simply benefitting from the recent AI hype.

Dont be fooled however& with the way the market is behaving, this stock could run up much further than any of us expect. I wanted to insult some of the analysts that are continuing to recommend buys and increasing POs, but they probably know it will continue to rise despite these fundamentals. Or they are pumping it up on purpose. Because of how crazy this is, Im staying on the sidelines. (I actually am just too poor to lose more money). Proceed with caution into any plays on this company.

2024-09-13,1726231650.0,RKLB - Potential Suitors?,"Watched a great Morgan Stanley presentation with the CFO of RKLB last night.  So much to like about the way their business is developing and the level-headed folks running it.  This wasn't part of this presentation, but I spent a good deal of time thinking afterwards about how things might play out for Rocket Lab in the near term.  I wonder if they don't become a target for some company who wants to have an end-to-end, ready-made constellation of communication satellites a la Starlink.   Why not purchase the company that develops, builds, and launches them for relative peanuts; before they really start generating positive revenue and the stock runs up?  

I'm thinking about you, APPLE!  What say you?  Talk amongst yourselves.  Who else might be a natural fit to buy a company like Rocket Lab?  I know APPLE is a left field idea, but heck, they almost went into the auto biz.

2024-06-15,1718426900.0,Tesla is the next 10 baggerI,"Currently Tesla has a near monopoly on self driving data and tech that comes with it. (Slowing down now but still large) I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, its even more bullish. 

This monopoly on self driving has allowed them to gain their spot in the magnificent 7 and be a major US stock. However, I think they could create something potential even more revolutionary.

2024-06-16,1718557133.0,SoFi: Overhyped or Underhyped?,"Everyone knows the story. A one stop shop for all your financial needs, the Apple of finance, the AWS of fintech... but the stock has not moved in over a year and is down 38% since its IPO. Probably mostly due to being overhyped at first, the macro uncertainty at the moment and the thought that this \*bank\* has not been tested on a real difficult macro environment. I probably wont say anything new existing bulls don't already know though, as the stock is cultish and has a very loyal following

However, in recent months, due to the constant negative stock price action there has been a real increase in negative sentiment on social media, with people saying that they are capitulating or are desperate to sell at the next uptick, and sofi bulls are being trashed all over social media, with bears being increasingly vocal as well. This increased so much so that even on SoFi Stock subreddit the mods said that they started letting more and more posts and comments straight up trashing the stock through, in part due to their large volume I believe.

Trading/investing on sentiment alone is never a good idea, \*unless\* the sentiment is trending in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. What's more, although insiders are net sellers atm, the CEO keeps buying the stock on every single dip, and institutional ownership has increased from around 32% to over 41% over the past year.

Why do I believe the fundamentals are trading in the opposite direction?

1. SoFi is valued like a moderately fast growing bank even though their pace of growth in margins and earnings for now is that of a tech company.
   * Their current P/B value (used to value banks) sits at around 1.17, with an all time high of 4.32 and low of 0,78, while JP Morgan is currently valued at 1.82. To be fair, JP Morgan's growth in book value per share has been 13.2% over the past 12 months, while SoFi's has been -0.9%, due to dilution.
   * Despite this, management has been determined to lower SBC as the company matures, and at the moment are in growth mode, focused on scaling their multiple business segments to make up 33% of their revenue each, this includes: Lending (currently significantly overweight in terms of revenue share), Financial Services, Tech Platform.
2. The current growth rate projected by management takes into account extremely conservative assumptions:
   * Lending is set to grow around 0% percent this year, as is management's conscious decision, reflecting an uncertain macro environment, with that rate having the potential to explode once default rates stabilize and projections are more clear.
   * Financial services are currently growing by more than 70% each year and are expected to grow by at least 50% every year for the next few years.
   * Tech platform is set to grow by at least 20% Y/Y. 
   * All of these rates assume no new product launches or ""unexpected"" sources of revenue. However, management has hinted that they are in talks with multiple top financial institutions about tech platform implementation, with ""a top 5 US bank"" having tested a proof of concept. This platform would help the banks switch from their old legacy software to one that is a lot more robust and able to accommodate modern online banking needs, as well as having people who actually know the coding language and so can help if any technical difficulties arise. Thing is, galileo is based in part on infrastructure-as-a-service model that allows SoFi to generate revenue based on their clients' size, for example generating a small profit every time a transaction is made on one of their clients' platforms. Having a large bank as their client would significantly accelerate their growth rate.
3. They turned profitable this year, and EPS growth is expected to continue, but not everyone is convinced.
   * They expect to grow from projected 0,08 in 2024 c to at least 0.50 to 0.80 c by 2026, which if done and continued would significantly aid in growing book value, if not demand a higher multiple, currently being at around 81 FWD PE (2024), but 13 FWD PE (2026).
   * The analysts and financial institutions are sceptical about this growth rate, and this is in part where the opportunity lies. The growth targets have been called ""aspirational"", and the first quarter that SoFi turned profitable, one analyst basically asked if they were rigging numbers.
   * There has also been some controversy surrounding their accounting, as they are using a method that assumes they would sell their loans rather than hold them to maturity, and the scepticism was that they would fail to sell due to reducing demand which would force them to account for higher losses on their balance sheet. However, they have demonstrated that even their unsecured loans are of the highest quality (FICO scores more than 750), and trusted by the market, by selling a significant number of their loans last quarter.
4. People are mostly happy with the product, SoFi is well rated, and their deposits are insured up to 2 mil due to the banking license, so customers probably feel their money is safe as well. They are dilligent with their product launches, the CEO has hinted that they were slow with Zelle implementation for example to ensure customers' security. Crypto has currently been discontinued, but the talks are ongoing with regulators, and with all the recent product launches, such as the crypto ETFs, it may come back at some point.
5. The management seems nimble, with Anthony Noto at the forefront, having kept up their growth rates despite losing their largest business segment (Student loans) a few years back, having completely transformed the business, and now focusing on improving other segments rather than unsecured loans when the default rates are still rising, this makes me trust their guidance a little more.

Investing in this company requires trusting that the managements' projections are honest and potentially conservative, and that they are able to execute, which they currently have a history of doing. There is a lot of mistrust in the market, however, which may be founded, but just seems overdone at the moment.

The bet would be that they sign up a large client within the next few quarters and significantly raise their guidance, which could make current price seem like peanuts.

Because of these reasons, I believe SoFi may currently be Underhyped.",wallstreetbets,83.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dhbykv/sofi_overhyped_or_underhyped/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9981957077980042

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!!, no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

2024-06-18,1718723798.0,XLK rebalancing 06/21 NVDA and AAPL,"As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold. 

Historically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the  ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.

For AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity. 

As this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1.

2024-06-14,1718399060.0,DD: Cloudflare,"
This post is about Cloudflare, the only technology company in my portfolio and a stock that Ive consistently held since 2020. Most of my other holdings are traditionally cheap value stocks, however, this is a company I understand well and have a lot of faith in the management. Ive also struggled to find good values in todays market lol (with this arguably not being a value in the traditional sense either).

Brace yourself for a long post: if you make it through would love to hear your thoughts.

Strategy:

Cloudflare is an edge network that functions as a reverse proxy for internet traffic. Traffic to internet properties (which include websites) is routed through a Cloudflare server to be more secure, fast and reliable.

According to one market study:
Cloudflare is used by 78.0% of all the websites whose reverse proxy service we know. This is 18.8% of all websites.

The company is unique because it owns its underlying network and is not hosted on one of the big public cloud providers. This was a pivotal decision made in the early days at Cloudflare, because it required making fixed cost investments and solving difficult software engineering problems. There are hundreds of Cloudflare data centers (known as points of presence or POPs) around the world and 95% of the internet connected world is within 50 ms of the Cloudflare network.

People familiar with the HBO show Silicon Valley know of the fictional startup Pied Piper and the idea of a decentralized peer to peer internet. Cloudflare has some interesting parallels to that idea with a decentralized approach to their data centers. Each data center is built with the same hardware, and is not specialized for any one use case like what many other cloud infrastructure providers have built out. This allows any data center in Cloudflares network to run any app or service and software controls everything.

Management breaks down their strategy down into 3 acts:

Act 1: Application Services

The company initially focused on offering a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver and host cached website assets around the world. It takes time (albeit not a lot) to make a network request and ultimately the speed of light traveling through the fiber optic cables is the limiting factor. Today, when you visit a website, instead of going all the way to a centrally located data center (such as Amazons us-east-1 data center located in northern Virginia), your network request likely hits a CDN near where you are located and delivers a version of the website.

Historically, CDNs were very underpowered and primarily handled only storage use cases. You can think of Cloudflare as one of the first enablers of compute power for CDNs. Cloudflare also took a software defined networking (SDN) approach that did not require physical boxes on premise. Many companies to this day have physical boxes to handle networking and application services that arent adapted to todays cloud native environment.
There have always been other CDN providers in the market but Cloudflare took market share by bundling its offering with other best in class networking and security products (such as DDoS protection) effectively for free. This allowed it to amass a free user base of over 3 million people, something rare for an enterprise software company.

Act 2: Network Services and Security Services

The next chapter for Cloudflare was the rapid launch of security products. The most prominent of this group is their suite of Zero Trust Security products. Zero Trust could be explained in much greater detail, but Ill attempt to do so at a high level. Traditionally, corporate networks were built under a castle and moat model. Once you got past the moat (getting credentials or any sort of access) you were in with the power to do anything within the company network. 

The Zero Trust philosophy is that when an employee accesses any individual resource, they should be authenticated and they should only have access to what they need. Cloudflare provides the infrastructure to enable this and competes with companies like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.
Cloudflare offers many other Act 1 and Act 2 products and to not kill my readers from boredom (if they even made it this far), Im going to end this section here.

Act 3: Developer and AI Services (and other Future Trends)

Cloudflare is benefiting from this market euphoria and is establishing itself as one of the early beneficiaries of AI. Cloudflare has evolved over time to position itself as the fabric that ties together the different clouds. Cloudflare sits atop of the other cloud infrastructure providers and is well suited for some AI workloads. Customers already include top AI companies and startups like OpenAI and Hugging Face. 

One example of this market positioning is Cloudflares object store called R2 (one less than Amazons object store called S3). Based on a market survey, it seems that S3 could be about a $1B revenue business (which almost equates to the entire revenue of Cloudflare today). 

Amazon makes a strategic move with S3 to charge users to move data off their cloud, but not charge to move data in. The costs to transfer out are known as egress fees, and this is inflated to cost users exponentially more than what it costs Amazon. Intuitively this does not make sense because Amazon made fixed cost investments to set up their network. Data travels in and out on the same fiber optic cables they laid out in the past. It doesnt make sense to charge different prices for data in vs data out since the underlying cost is the same and approaches 0. The key objective for Amazon is to lock you in. Amazon stands to benefit if customers pick them and over their competitors. Cloudflare on the other hand, actually wants to enable so called multi cloud systems, since it can serve as the control plane for data movement and capture that new market.

With egress fees it can be economically unviable to use multiple cloud providers. Say Microsoft has the best AI APIs because of their OpenAI tie up, but youre a user of AWS. Moving the data off AWS to use the Azure offering would cost a lot of money. Often times, training data sets are also massive, so moving them is even more costly. Cloudflare eliminates this cost and is slowly becoming a platform of choice for AI startups for this use case.

Another market that Cloudflare seems poised to capture a share of is what is known as inference, the act of AI models making conclusions and judgements. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it is doing inference. It is attempting to make a prediction based on all the training data it has. Most use cases of AI will likely be inference since you want the model to generate a response based on what you ask it. A lot of inference today occurs in the centralized data centers and high latency adversely impacts customer experience. When Cloudflare built out their network, every point of presence was built out with the same hardware and they even reserved a slot for GPUs, processors needed for AI workloads. Now, the network can easily be upgraded and retrofitted with GPUs with minimal additional capital expenditures. Cloudflare management thinks a lot of AI inference will likely happen closer to the end user, since it is not as demanding as training which has to be done in the centralized data center. 

We are seeing this inference cloud of sorts from Apple as well, further validating this idea. I need to read more, but Apples Private Cloud Compute they announced at WWDC will be a network of their own servers to offload some of the compute from iPhones for more intensive AI tasks. Apple predictably is doing this in house and has the advantage of using their own silicon. However, this proves that local devices arent necessarily powerful (RAM is the limiting factor) to run large models we use today.

Cloudflares edge network is beneficial in data governance/localization use cases as well. Some progressive governments have introduced data collection and privacy laws. In the EU there is GDPR, regulations that give users more control over their data. One trend developing is that nations are requiring data of their citizens to stay within their borders. This is a very costly problem to solve for many of the public clouds today (even Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). They would have to spend a lot of money to reconfigure how their data centers are set up and create new software to handle how that data is routed.

The last market expansion avenue Id like to highlight is Cloudflare Workers. Workers is a framework used to program Cloudflares edge network. There are many use cases for Workers and Cloudflare does not use it in its total addressable market estimates since it is so hard to estimate. One use case mentioned during Cloudflares investor day was Meta using it for WhatsApp. Each WhatsApp message is injected with some information used for authenticating the message by a Cloudflare Worker. This happens for billions of messages per day and really demonstrates its scale and versatility. I imagine Workers will be a huge driver of revenue at some point in the near future.

Workers AI was recently launched and seems like a very easy way for developers to build apps and connect services to Cloudflares network. I will be monitoring this and seeing if there are new apps launching that use this and would love to see the developer community explode here.

Valuation:

Cloudflares products strategically complement each other and are economically attractive because of the upfront financial and technical decisions that were made when the company was founded. 

Cloudflare benefits from a zero/low marginal cost structure that technology companies often benefit from. The high fixed cost investments (building servers and laying fiber optic cables to create the network) are slowly depreciated over time through the income statement and appear in the form of capital expenditures on the cash flow statement. The network also benefits from being incredibly efficient and operates at a high utilization rate where traffic is routed optimally. 

The company generates over 1.4B in ARR and is growing at around 30%. It operates at north of 75% gross margins and is slightly free cash flow positive, but some amount of shares are being issued to fund employee stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense is the unfortunate reality at most technology companies and many try to falsely claim profitability with adjusted figures where that cost is excluded.

On to the balance sheet, where there isnt a ton of capital in this business at only about ~2B. There is only about 700M worth of equity (assets - liabilities), meaning it trades at a massive premium at 35x equity. With a stock like this youre betting on very high revenue growth and the ability to earn an incredibly high return on invested capital and equity. Although there is network capex (about 10-12% of revenues), Cloudflare is still very asset light and its servers seem to be easily upgradable with minimal additional investment. As mentioned earlier, the foresight to equip every data center with the same hardware and even leaving a slot for GPUs really illustrates this point. The asset light model is advantageous because inflation always eats away earnings growth. If you need to keep putting up a lot of capital to simply operate your business youre really fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, given Cloudflares mission critical offerings of security, speed, and reliability, there is potential of eventual pricing power in my view. The consistent addition of new products and services also increase the value proposition and enables future price increases.

Despite all that, it is still very difficult to value this company because it implies the analyst can predict the earnings potential of the limited amount of capital that exists in the business. There is a lot of so called economic goodwill (not traditional accounting goodwill) in this business and it demands a price that is far in excess of what is measurable. However, given the cost structure, total addressable market, efficiency of the network, and strategic vision, I believe the revenue growth can be above 20% for the next 5 or so years and the company can achieve high levels of profitability. Serving an additional customer is not very costly and reaching greater scale results in greater profitability. In regards to competition, I think being the only vendor to offer products across a wide range of business needs is favorable. 

I did a simple DCF model where I attempt to value the company. Most of the value comes in the terminal stage, as this company is reinvesting back into the business to fund its growth ambitions and produces no meaningful cash today. The management team aims to generate $5B in revenue by the year 2026, which may be ambitious. I find it to be worth about $15B in todays dollars and that approximates the price I paid for it. I have added stock based compensation back in the cash flows and also increased the share count. Ive assumed most of the capex will eventually be maintenance capex. Cloudflare has proven with their architectural advantages that growth capex is fairly low. As a result, the net margin could be very similar to the free cash flow margin (lower if you add back SBC in FCF).

Management:

The CEO of Cloudflare is Matthew Prince who owns about 10% of the company. Prince has made brilliant strategic moves as discussed throughout this article and often sees things before they happen. The founding team was inspired by their professor at Harvard Business School, Clayton Christensen. Christensen is credited with one of the most influential business theories of all time: Dispruption Theory. His book, the Innovators Dilemma, discusses how many of the worlds largest companies over the course of history have faced an existential crisis leading to their fall from grace. This typically happens because incumbent companies are slow to adopt change. They ignore disruptive technologies that do not meet the needs of their main customers. These technologies improve over time and eventually overtake the existing technologies and its too late by the time incumbents adjust.
In Christensens terms, Cloudflare started as a classic low end disruption business model. They captured a large market share in networking and security products by offering their products for free. Now they are aiming to move up market to displace traditional security vendors and find a niche to coexist in the cloud infrastructure market dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. 

Concluding Thoughts: 

Cloudflare is a promising company that trades at an expensive price. I believe it is one of the few technology companies that can grow into its premium valuation over time and it remains one of my highest conviction companies. There is always risk and uncertainty when the companys value primarily stems from its terminal cash flows (and is also the only company in my portfolio with such an extreme setup). However, I am comfortable taking a risk on Cloudflare and anticipate it will be a very successful business.",wallstreetbets,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dg19ef/dd_cloudflare/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9476507306098938

Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.  
  
YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).  
However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):  
\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).  
  
***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***  
  
A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

  
**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**  
  
I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SEan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.  
  
It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.  
  
Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Gogoro Partner News**  
  
March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies  an incredible accomplishment!  
  
With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**  
  
\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.  
  
**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know**  
  
\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).  
  
**Battery Swapping Network**  
  
\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

2024-04-29,1714410887.0,"Liquidating inherited IRA, wanting to build diversity ","In late 2020 I inherited a traditional IRA from my mom, which I need to liquidate within 10 years. Current holdings in the IRA are Apple and Microsoft. I am interested in taking equal distributions from the IRA for the remainder of the 10 year limit, maxing my own Roth IRA, and potentially reinvesting any additional funds after the max Roth contribution. Im trying to decide the best investments moving forward.

For additional context, I am 47. I want to retire no later than 62. I will have an estimated pension of about 60% of my pre retirement income at that time, and Social Security will bump that up to maybe 75-80% (though Im not counting on that in my calculations). I will also have a health insurance subsidy that will cover a large portion of my insurance needs. While its late in the game, I have begun contributing to a 457b and plan to begin maxing that every year until retirement. My plan would also be to continue maxing the Roth IRA until retirement, as well as make the catch up contributions after 50.

I have an investment portfolio in addition to the IRA that is currently stacked pretty heavily with NVDA. I plan to hold NVDA long term, but possibly sell and reinvest some at some point.

Im leaning towards an index fund in the Roth to balance out the more risky holdings in the other account. I do not actively trade and am primarily interested in long term stable growth investments. Im fairly new to this and wondering if this seems like the right track.

2024-05-01,1714535461.0,What I wish I knew before...,"I was doing %100 discretionary macro before I found this 4 years ago. I like macro and it comes easy to me, but it was always stressful  and I wanted a strategy that brought more peace but still had high returns. I searched every corner of the internet and stumbled upon this. Very few people will listen, and most will mock me, but this post isn't for them. This post is for the old me that was searching for answers and was ready to change and get started on a solid foundation for fundamental analysis by following the example of some of the greatest of all time. Ok here we go!

The go-to strategy for most people is a low cost index fund. The idea behind this is called the Efficient Market Hypothesis. This idea says that all publicly available information is already reflected in the price of all financial assets. Under this idea, the only way to beat the stock market is to have insider information and to be doing insider trading, because insiders have insider information that is not yet available to the public. Once that information goes public, the information becomes useless.


What people don't understand is that in order for markets to be efficient, there has to be liquidity. Take Apple stock for example. Apple has about $10 billion dollars a day in trading volume, meaning that everyday $10 billion dollars worth of Apple stock is traded on the stock market. This liquidity is what makes it possible for new information to reflect itself in the price without friction. The liquidity allows for a large number of people to analyze the stock and buy and sell freely. Large investors need this liquidity and cannot invest in assets with low liquidity. The richer a person becomes, the smaller their universe of stocks becomes, because they need stocks with more and more liquidity. If a large number of people cannot invest in a stock because it is illiquid, then the possibility opens up that the stock could become inefficiently priced.


What makes the strategy possible is the ""illiquidity premium"". The stock market can be divided into several layers depending on the size of corporations. There are (in descending order), Mega Caps, Large Caps, Mid Caps, Small Caps, Micro Caps, and Nano Caps. The smaller we go, the more illiquid the market becomes which allows for more opportunity to find stocks that are trading at ""inefficient"" prices. However, our chances don't really go up until we get to the nano caps (companies traded below $30 million dollars in market cap). The people investing in nano caps are individual investors and maybe some boutique investment funds because nano caps are too illiquid for large players. As far as I know, there are no nano cap ETFs or mutual funds because they cannot handle the illiquidity. There are some micro cap ETFs and mutual funds however.


Now we know what pond to be fishing in, but we still don't know how to fish. We need a strategy that:

#1: Requires no skill, and is accessible to anyone who can do basic math.

#2 Doesn't take a lot of time.

#3 It should be conservative because we want to keep our money safe. 

#4 It should also have a return significantly higher than a broad stock market index because, if it doesn't, then what is the point?


Does this strategy exist? Yes! It is called the Net-Net strategy and it is the highest returning quantitative strategy that I know of. It was invented by Benjamin Graham, who was Warren Buffets mentor. Warren Buffet himself used the strategy for the first 20 years of his career. He stopped using the strategy because he eventually ran into liquidity issues.



The Strategy:


The best way to introduce it is to use an analogy. Imagine someone has a really crappy car. It still runs but the wheels are about to fall off, the paint is chipped and it's making a bunch of noises that are a sure sign of trouble. Could this car be a good investment? Surely not, since it is going to get sent to the scrap yard at any moment. But what if the owner offered to sell it to you at a %50 discount to its scrap value? Now it becomes an attractive investment because we might be able to sell it above its scrap value, since it is still running after all. But if we can't, we can drive it over to the scrap yard, double our money and ride back home on public transportation with a wad of cash in our pocket. Makes sense right?


Take that logic and transfer it over to corporations. The idea is to buy stock in corporations trading below their scrap value. If you were to buy a stock like this, and the next day the management announced the company will be liquidated, you would make money. 


The formula for finding the scrap value is to add up all the current (liquid) assets (cash, inventory etc...) and subtract all liabilities. The result is the Net Current Asset Value (NCAV). This is a generic formula for finding the approximate scrap value of a company. The fixed assets (real estate, factories etc...) are ignored and considered as a cherry on top. The most thorough way to find scrap value is to find the liquidation value of the fixed assets as well, but this takes time and the generic formula is good enough. Simple right? It might sound intimidating if you have never heard accounting terms but trust me this is as easy as it gets. If you can operate a can opener, then you can do this basic formula.

If the stock price has a %33 or more discount to NCAV, it is now a candidate for investment. But first it has has to meet 7 more criteria before we invest. 


#1 It needs to be an operational company. Seems obvious but if you aren't using a screener, or have a crappy screener, you have to check to make sure it's not just a shell corporation. We will talk more about screeners later.


#2 Is the company owner operated? Why should I have a stake in the company if the management doesn't have a stake in the company? This is actually considered optional by most people doing this strategy but I consider it mandatory, except in special situations. I like to see that the CEO owns at least 5 years salary worth of stock. I also like to see the CEO buying stock on the open market but that doesn't always happen.


#3 The company needs to have a current ratio  above 1.5. A current ratio is a fancy way of calculating if the company has an emergency fund for a rainy day. They need to have enough liquid assets to cover short term liabilities. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities.


#4 The company needs to have a low debt to equity ratio (D/E). This is a simple way to check if there is too much debt. Too much debt could bankrupt a company. First we calculate the equity by adding up all assets and subtracting all liabilities. This is the Net Asset Value (NAV). I like to strip out intangibles and goodwill to calculate Net Tangible Asset Value (NTAV or NTA), but this is optional. Once we have the equity (NAV), we divide the total liabilities by the equity. Some people only divide the long term debt by the equity. We want the D/E ratio to be %50 or lower. Statistically, companies with %20 or lower have had the best returns.


#5 The company needs to have a low burn rate. Generally when companies are trading below scrap value, they are experiencing problems that are hopefully short term. They are generally going through a period of unprofitability. Since they are not able to meet all their expenses from selling product, they may rely on their emergency fund to get them through the tough times. However, we need to see that they have control of their expenses and that they are not burning through their emergency fund too fast. We check this by tracking their NCAV through time.


#6 The company shouldn't be diluting shares. Another way companies can get cash to make it through the tough times, is to sell shares in the open market. Most people running this strategy do not tolerate any share dilution.


#7 The company should have been profitable in the past 10 years. If the company has already been in trouble for over 10 years and they haven't fixed the problem, then the company might be dying. We want companies facing short term problems, not long term problems.


That's basically it. How has the strategy performed? It returns ~25% per year. Don't believe me? Here is a link to a few independent studies:
 https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/why-and-how-to-implement-a-net-net-investment-strategy-world-wide

Since the strategy is quantitative in nature and doesn't require investment skill, it can be backtested and many backtests have been performed by different people.


Since this is a statistical strategy, we want to hold 20 stocks at a time to protect ourselves from single stock risk. The stocks are held for a year and then whatever no longer fits the criteria is sold and replaced. The losers are sold before the year end and the winners are sold after a year end to maximize tax efficiency.


Okay so now that the strategy is explained, we have to actually find these stocks. Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett had to comb through thousands of stocks by hand, but we live in modern times and we no longer have to do this. The way to find the stocks is to use a screening tool. The screen searches through a financial data base of stocks and pulls out all the stocks trading below NCAV. A high quality screener will also screen for the 7 things I outlined, except for insider ownership,  that you have to do yourself. With a high quality screener, I can just pluck 20 stocks from the screen and buy them. I don't have to do any calculations or further research. If I have a crummy screener, I will have to check everything myself.


If you have a good screen, the only work is actually buying and selling the stocks. Since the stocks are illiquid, there is usually a large spread between the bid and ask price. You will have to learn how to place your own limit orders and it could take weeks to get your orders filled. So there will be work in managing the portfolio. Getting locked into investments from illiquidity is not a problem. I am in contact with several people running the strategy and getting locked into an investment  has never come up in conversation but it is technically possible, especially if you have a lot of money. But in general, if you are able to buy the stock, then you will be able to sell the stock. The strategy becomes difficult to implement once the investor has $5-$10 million dollars. Once you get over $5 million, you may have issues buying and selling and you will get locked out of the strategy eventually. This is what happened to Warren Buffett. Once he got locked out, he had to adjust his strategy and became the investor he is today.


The reason why you have never heard of Net-Nets is because nobody has a financial incentive to tell you about it. Wall Street is not going to tell you about it because they cannot package it into an ETF or mutual fund to sell it to you. Rich people are not going to tell you about it because they can't focus on it (because of liquidity). Maybe your financial advisor would tell you IF they were competent. But as we all know, they are not competent, which is why we fired them and bought an index fun instead. This strategy has fallen into obscurity because markets have become so efficient, but it is still used among a small group of people in the most inefficient stratum of the market, the nano caps.


That about wraps it up. I want this information  to get out there because I want to see you succeed in your financial goals. I just happened to stumble on this, but if you don't tumble down the right rabbit hole, you will never find out about this. But now you have! Knowledge is power.

For example, Apple just authorized a 100 billion dollar buy back. In a vacuum, buying back stock lowers Apple's market cap, thus lowering its weight in an ETF like $SPY.

My question is, in theory, are ""buy backs"" bad or at least indifferent to passive Index ETFs? If my thinking is correct, dividends would be better for passive index ETF investors because the market cap weighting remains the same and the return of capital increases.

In practice, buy backs are probably a net positive because Apple went up almost 200 billion in market cap based on announcing a 100 billion buy back in their earnings release.

2024-05-10,1715364787.0,Real Estate vs. The Market - An answer to all those touting real estate as the way out there,"Real estate has often been touted as one of the most accessible ways to grow real wealth. Who among us ambitious havent heard the platitudinous claims passed off as conventional wisdom or perhaps as an arcane right of passage into occult upper echelons of society?

*Real estate makes more millionaires than any other industry.*

We have heard it in forums, self-help books, and from passing snake oil peddlers trying to get you to sign up for their educational seminar so you too can get rich.

As an engineer fortunate enough to not be living pay check to pay check as many Americans do, I also found this promise alluring. After all the basic principle that you can own a second home and collect a sizable and secure supplemental income certainly seems like a good deal at first approximation and so when me and my wife moved out of our first home for new jobs, we decided to keep it as a rental property rather than sell it.

We had purchased the property for only $130,000 dollars in 2017 and after living there for about five years the value had doubled. It was also located in an above average area of growth in South Carolina that had seen explosive growth going from Hicksville, USA to having two Starbucks by the time we moved out (of course the number of Starbucks is the proper measure of affluence). We were able to rent the house out with ease for two years for $1,800 a month while all of the recurring costs amounted to only $1,000 a month.

Indeed on paper it was an excellent investment. But when a difficult tenant started to stress us out we began to wonder if having a rental was worth all the hype in comparison to less stressful alternative investments.

So I decided that rather than scouring the internet for advice from likely unqualified faceless charlatans, I would conduct my own analysis of owning a rental home vs. simply investing in the stock market. After all, at one point in the not so distant past relying on your own mind rather than the top 10 Google search results to reach your own conclusions was considered desirable.

# The Calculation

My methodology was to calculate the total net benefit over the next 22 years (the time until the house would be paid off) in todays dollars of keeping the rental vs. the total net benefit in todays dollars of selling it and investing the proceeds in an index fund for 22 years and compare the two results. Although seemingly simple, the reality is that the financials of rentals are convoluted and comparing them to neat investments is *actually kind of difficult.* There are a lot of assumptions and extrapolations that must be made about both benefits and expenses.

The total net benefit for market investing was actually pretty simple. I estimated that the total proceeds from a sale after everything was said and done would be $100,000. So simply applied compounding interest to calculate the value Id have in 22 years.

For this I assumed the historical average market return of 10% (7% accounting for inflation) as well as a few other higher returns to see how I would fare if things went well.

Because I will not be retired in 22 years and this money would be growing in a traditional taxed brokerage account, I made the assumption that if I wanted to derive regular income from the final capital I would have to sell everything and take the fat 15% long-term capital gains tax in order to move the money from an index fund into a high yield fund providing a yield of 5%. I then further assumed that as income I would have to pay 29% of those earnings in federal and state taxes. This yielded the total income I could expect in my pocket every month after investing for 22 years.

Total derived benefit and possible income for investing $100,000 in index funds after 22 years.

The calculation for the house was much more tenuous, but as I mentioned earlier, you do have to make some big assumptions to make a comprehensive assessment of the total net benefit of renting a house for 22 years. I started by calculating the **total positive factors**:

**Total rent ** Assuming that I will increase rent at 3% to keep up with inflation, I assumed an average rent value for a total present day value of all collected rents over 22 years of $468,600. I then adjusted this value for an assumed vacancy rate of 8% to yield **$431,112 (A)**.

**Appreciation**  Of course one of the benefits of real estate is that it generally appreciates at a rate that is commensurate with the desirability of the location. Before things exploded circa 2022 and houses got crazy expensive, the rate of appreciation in my area was just under 5%. This is a good bit better than the historical national average of 3.5%. Since it is a higher growth area in South Carolina where Ill used the higher number. At 5% appreciation (2% after accounting for inflation) I can expect the house value to grow from the present value of $250,000 to about $386,494 or an increase of **$136,494 (B)** in todays dollars.

Although there are *many* other potential benefits of renting a house, at the basic level, the benefits are from rent and appreciation. So the total gross benefit can be calculated simply by adding **A+B** for a total of **$567,606.**

However, the story doesnt stop there. There are also negatives or *expenses* associated with owning a rental property. The **total negative factors** were calculated as:

**Capital gains tax on sale-** It turns out that when you sell your house after many years of appreciation you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the profit. *There actually are ways around this* but as we will discuss later they probably are pretty useless to the average one-off real estate investor. So since I paid $130,000 for the house and expect it to be worth $386,494 when I ultimately sell it 22 years from now, the net profit is $256,494 which is taxed at 15% costing **$38,474 (A)**.

**Depreciation recapture tax-** When you rent out a house you get to depreciate its value every year like any other large capital assett in a business. This means you can kind of say you lost a certain amount of value every year from use. That depreciation ultimately helps lower your taxes every year and so it is a benefit&.kind of.

When the time comes to sell your house, you actually have to pay the government back for all the asset depreciation you claimed. You could try to figure this out yourself, but I just used an online calculator and figured that I would have to pay about **$31,200 (B)** in depreciation recapture tax.

**Sales cost ** There are also significant costs associated with actually selling your house. Things like real estate agent commissions and repairs can really add up. Based on some internet research I saw that 8% is a reasonable number for sales cost. It could be more if there are many repairs needed. At 8% it would cost **$30,920 (C)** to sell a house for $386,494.

The total **future expenses at time of sale** can be calculated as **A+B+C** or $100,594. However, this is in 2046 dollars (22 years from 2024). This has to be adjusted to be in present 2024 dollars for the purpose of comparison. The adjusted number in 2024 dollars works out to **$58,432 (D)**.

**Maintenance ** There are also repairs to consider. Any repairs that are not covered by the rent payments come out of your pocket. There are a lot of assumptions that you have to make here. I was actually pretty light on repairs assuming that the tenant wouldnt trash the place and that only predictable things would need to get done. This included things like replacing the roof once, changing the carpet out three times in 22 years, and painting the place several times, and replacing the wooden privacy fence once. I also made the assumption that most of the repairs would be sooner rather than later. I browsed the internet to get estimated repair costs and life expectancy numbers. For 22 years I estimated **$75,000 (E)** (in todays dollars). Honestly, I think this number is very light and could easily see it being twice that.

So everything said and done, the total gross expense in present money can be found by adding **D** and **E** for a **total of $133,432.**

The **total net benefit** can *finally* be calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total benefits, or **$434,174** ($567,606  $133,432 )**.**

When we compare this with the estimated stock market returns, we see that it is on par with the 11% return (8% after inflation) which is slightly better than the more conservative 7% often quoted. So at that it looks like real estate wins! & however there is still more to consider.

# Other Considerations

Remember why I started looking at this in the first place? I said that having a rental property was beginning to stress me out. Even with a property management company running things the reality is that it is impossible for them to take care of your property the way you would want to. They arent there day in and day out noticing the slow degradation of condition. Yes, they will catch the big things and hopefully boot tenants that are trashing the place, but the insidious decay will be left un-noticed until it becomes a big enough problem.

For me, being emotionally attached to the house, I find this to be *incredibly stressful.* It is fair to say that not everyone feels that way about their properties, some are able to treat them strictly as business assets that require repair when they stop working. However, you really cant discount the psychological affects of dealing with someone who doesnt care about your home the way you do.

So now we are talking about 22 years of stress. That is 22 years of worrying if you are going to go in to sell the place and find that the house should be condemned and repairs would take a tremendous chunk out of what you expected (possible A LOT more than that $75k we estimated). That is 22 years of stress dealing with tenants and having to watch their ridiculous and rude maintenance tickets come through your email where they call you a slum lord and tell you that the carpet looks like someone took a shit on it (mind you *this* is who is living in the house you once loved).

*Is it still worth the difference?*

That is a personal determination that everyone in this situation must make on their own. In my case, I am leaning towards no.

*But why does everyone make a bid deal out of real estate? If the actual returns are comparable to the market, why is it so special?*

Now *that* is the question, and I think that we are ready to answer it given the context of the above analysis.

If the total net benefit really is comparable to the market then why in the hell would anyone want to dabble in real estate let alone claim it is *the way?*

I am hardly the Supreme Overlord Barron Lord Admiral of real estate investing, but I know enough to tell you that the reasons have to do with those secondary benefits we deferred from earlier.

The primary benefit of real estate is *leverage.* Leverage is the idea that you can own a house using primarily someone elses money (i.e., the banks through a mortgage). This means you get the full benefit of owning a house and renting it (full appreciation, equity, and rent proceeds) with minimal investment of your own. You are taking out a loan to buy an asset and having someone else pay for it. Leverage is possible for stock investing, but houses are much more secure investments and banks realize this and so the rates and terms are much more reasonable than taking out a loan to buy stocks. So why would you ever want to give that up?

The reality is that you are only leveraged while you are &. well, leveraged. As your equity in the house increases (either by paying down the mortgage or through appreciation) you become less leveraged. That is to say that magical benefit of real estate decreases with the less you owe.

Look at it this way. Say you only owe the bank one more dollar on your mortgage; while you still dont own the house outright, you have nearly 100% equity. That equity is effectively *your money* (not the banks) that can be applied to anything and thus it carries an opportunity cost. That is, you have to compare what it is doing for you tied up in the house to what you could get from the market or other investments. If the situation were flipped and you only had one dollar of equity, it is a **much** better deal& you couldnt do much else with that single dollar. *The more equity you have in your house, the less leveraged it is, and the more it acts like a traditional stock.*

What youll find, is that houses perform very much like high dividend, low growth stocks. That is, they provide good income, but appreciate less than the market. When we do the comparison (as we did above) it really does come out as more of a wash than many burgeoning real estate investors might think.

There are other benefits to owning a home. For example, it is real and has an intrinsic value; when the next great depression happens, people will still need a place to live. Plus, since mortgages dont change with time (that is they get cheaper with time due to inflation) *you* could live there during difficult times, probably for much less than your current rent or mortgage.

Although these are secondary considerations, there are also creative financial mechanisms available for homes. For example, home equity loans or lines of credit can give you a better rate when you need money compared to a private loan. There are also mechanisms to avoid having to pay taxes on your gains (possibly until you die) such as 1031 exchanges, however these are very complicated and are really only designed for real estate investors to turn one property into another. They are nearly useless for the average Joe with maybe one rental (big surprise).

We also hear a lot about the tax benefits of owning rental property. What are those? Well you can claim depreciation. Depreciation is the governments way of acknowledging that large capital business assets (think a large factory machine) lose value over time as they are used. So you are generally allowed to claim back the full purchase price of your home over the course of 30 years which helps to offset taxes on the rental income. However, you *do have to pay it all back* when you sell the house in a process called depreciation recapture tax. So maybe it isnt that much of a benefit after all&.the real benefit is that since you pay it back later it is worth less due to inflation. Not a huge benefit& You can also claim business operating expenses to also help offset your rental income (think new roof, new windows, repairs, project management fees etc.).

So now seeing the whole picture it is obvious that there are *some* benefits to owning a rental home over investing in the stock market. However, they may not be what you thought. Lets recap:

* **The total net benefit from renting a house, vs. investing in the market is likely comparable.**
* **Renting a house is much more stressful (even with a management company) than investing in the stock market. You have to have the right kind of personality to not be affected by people trashing your place, being rude to you, and, if this was a home you lived in, the steady decay of a home you once loved (because no, management companies do not maintain houses like you did when you lived there). There is also (id argue) a lot more variability in how youll fare with real estate (assumptions about vacancy rate, long-term repairs, etc.)**
* **The primary benefit of owning rentals is the ability to leverage into a stable investment on favorable terms. The more of your house you own, the more they perform like traditional stocks and the less argument there is for keeping it due to the opportunity cost of your tied up equity.**
* **There are some secondary benefits, pertaining to taxes, the actual utility of the home, and some creative financing opportunities.**

**So in conclusion:** what does this mean? It means in an apple to apple comparison houses are good investments that rival stock markets but they are much more stressful. However, with leverage being the primary benefit *there is* a real advantage here if you are willing to maximize your leverage in the real estate market.

If you are going to have one house and pay it off and keep it for income, Id advise you to consider other options if it is stressing you out as (1) it wont make you rich and (2) it may not be better than the markets. **However,** if you are going to go big and leverage leverage (no not a typo) there is a possibility to do well.

So what does that mean? Money is made in real estate at the front end by making good investments and using (and I mean USING leverage). If you are willing to maximize your credit and home equity usage as much as possible to buy more and more houses putting as little of your own money into each one as possible and you are willing to have a part or full-time job dealing with managing them all and it wont stress you out, it is **a** path to wealth. Of course, you could also do well just dropping that $100k into the S",investing,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1cow4e0/real_estate_vs_the_market_an_answer_to_all_those/,Other,POSITIVE,0.988610029220581

March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S",investing,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9871900677680969

Rather than doing homework, traveling the Amalfi coast on a yacht, ripping bongs, and eating thongs, Id rather spend a moment sharing my thoughts on HOOD. Not your boyfriends wifes husbands HOOD. Im talking about Robinhood, the innovator for the investor. Not Cuckles Schwab or Fuckidtly.  I hope youre ready for a highly regarded DD supporting my 160k tuition bill. To get in front of the dildo in the room, in 2021, Robinhood screwed me and many others over on a lot of money, but look, just because your hoe makes a mistake, you dont get rid of your hoe.

2024-06-12,1718165378.0,CPI data &amp; the US Fed,"Today may be a consequential date for 2 reasons:

CPI data print: May CPI data will be released at 8:30 ET. Bloomberg survey indicates an expectation of 0.1% [very optimistic in my opinion].
Previous, CPI readings were as per below:

Jan: 0.3%
Feb: 0.4%
Mar: 0.4%
Apr: 0.3%

Bloomberg survey also indicated Y-o-Y expectation of 3.4% [so no way near Fed's target of 2% inflation].

Fed speak: Fed will finish its 2 days meeting and spell out its plan for the current month. It is unlikely to present any surprises. 

How will the market react?

Last week, the markets were optimistic following rate cut by ECB and Canada. However, strong non farm pay roll report [272 K vs expectation of 185 K] did put a dampner at least for 7th June closing. 

Apple's share price breakout on 11th June still suggests investors strong appetite for risky asset class.

Even if there is a sell off on 12th June, it is likely to recover quickly on back of strong earnings of any of the major companies like Broadcom, Adobe, Autodesk etc.

But, if sell off is coupled with weak earnings this week then near term correction may be deeper.

Conclusion: Markets are at or near all time high. Despite sticky inflation and US Fed reluctance to cut rates: appetite among investors for risky assets class stays strong.

2024-09-09,1725892508.0,Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued ,"There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. 

  
This however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. 

  
First it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: 

\* Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. 

\* Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV.

\* The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. 

\* Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. 

\* Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. 

\* Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. 

\* Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. 

\* TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. 

\* Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. 

\* Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. 

\* Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. 

\*Intel lost Apple.

\*Intel has no phone chips. 

  
All of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. 

  
While 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. 

  
There was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. 

  
Arrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows:

\* Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4

\* Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. 

\* Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. 

\* Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. 

\* Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. 

  
It's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. 

Intel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs).  

The final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. 

  
It's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom. ",wallstreetbets,85.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fcqxl3/intel_is_a_pretty_safe_bet_and_are_undervalued/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9903873801231384

Intel shouldn't even be splitting the company into 2. IDM has always and will be the biggest possibility for Intel to come back to the top. What they need to think is how to lower the cost of manufacturing. To me, they shouldn't be freezing Germany fabs, they should stopped it.

Building the fabs in preparation of Intel 18A while they are the lifeblood of next-gen products are just detrimental to the health of the company. They are going to move majority of the products in house. That means a ton of wafer that is going to be needed. Where can they be build? Currently it seems like much investment have to be made ahead of time, which hurts profit margin so much.

2024-07-18,1721309203.0,RDDT is going to crush its next 2 earnings and you are overlooking it,"**""B-but reddit sucks and fuck spez... amirite?""** Yeah yeah yeah, it's super cool to hate on Reddit as a Redditor.

That doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.

**""But Reddit has never made a profit""** - Yes, low expectations are why this is an opportunity. As dumb as it sounds, Reddit has never *tried* to be profitable. This is changing as they are now a public company with fiduciary responsibility.

1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest. They are beginning to **finally** enable effective target marketing based on user interests, demographics, etc. **Remember, Reddit user interests and hobbies are neatly sorted into what subreddits they are subscribed to, visit, and their comment history.** I can feed an AI a Reddit user's comment history and it will create a pretty accurate profile of their interests, hobbies, age, location, and problems. **This is a medium absolutely RIPE for advertising, and Reddit's recent partnership with OpenAI WILL be leveraged for both target marketing and advertisement creation.**
2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers. 
3. **Reddit user growth 37% YoY -** Reddit's partnership with Google is serving up Reddit to normies in swathes. People who might not have been aware of it have been using it for research, opinions, hobbies, etc. Many of these people will, and are, being pulled in as full reddit users. **I caught my normie wife using reddit for her crafting hobbies and pregnancy products research. People are appending ""reddit"" to their Google searches because they crave authentic human discussion**. This is not even mentioning short term catalysts for people visiting reddit for human discussion: *2024 US presidential election and associated turmoil*
4. **Reddit user demographics -** Reddit is inherently commercial. People discuss purchases, hobbies, and interests constantly. Its users are also largely high income individuals in 1st world countries between the ages of 18 to 40. This is the most valuable demographic for advertisers, as these people actually have discretionary spending ability.
5. **Reddit's moat and competitive advantage** - Reddit's collection of communities and cultures spanning almost every interest has kept it growing steadily for over a decade. No other single platform beats it for ANY individual to find several communities that meet their interests in one place, share news, participate in authentic human discussion, and access a treasure trove of questions asked by users over the past decade. Reddit doesn't always have the best answers to questions, but its discussions are largely real people sharing honest opinions, and that has a lot of value.

-----------Long term bull cases----------

**6. AI Data Deals** - AI is getting more advanced and will rapidly continue to do so for the next decade. Reddit contains 15 years of human discussion on every topic imaginable, and it is constantly building its data for every fresh topic. This is a valuable data source for LLM training, and there could be growth in this sector. **""B-But pizza glue"" -** We are still in the early stages, and the pros will outweigh the cons long term.

**7. Reddit Marketplace** - It's only a matter of time before reddit facilitates C2B and C2C transactions for its many hobbies and interests. There is money to be made there.

8. **Meme stock potential -** Reddit has made the news countless times. For the past few years, it has become a meme stock generator attracting the attention of institutions and retail investors alike. If it starts to spike, which it will, I can see the potential for a ""meme buy-in"" of a stock like RDDT.

9. **Acquisition** - If big tech decides to acquire reddit for any number of good reasons, you win as a shareholder as they will pay a premium.

10. **International expansion and AI translation -** Reddit is investing heavily in using AI to translate all content as human readable across all languages, with the goal of connecting people internationally and expanding its audience internationally. There is a shit ton of money to be made internationally and it is only a matter of time before this occurs.

**""When is the next earnings call?""** - August 6th. I think this has the potential to crush, and the following one in early November will have even more potential.

**Similar company valuation comparison:** I believe the following valuations are FAIR for how much revenue has been reported recently, but I believe it does not account for what will be a big surge in RDDT revenue. Reddit will easily meet the valuation of Pinterest, making it 3x. Longer term, I see 8x-10x.

**RDDT - 10.6bil**

**PINTEREST - 28bil**

**SNAP - 24bil**

""but ....MILLIONS OF MILES ON TESLA WORLDWIDE"". Just listened to Cathy Wood's latest interview, and this was her whole argument for buying more and more TSLA

This is complete BS argument, and for these people I have only one thing to say. Google was and is the king in Data, yet we have ChatGPT and Anthropics took them by surprised. They have fraction of data that google has, yet they are far better LLM model than Gemini. It clearly isn't about quantity of data, more so on quality and how  it is used to train your model.

Same thing for selfdriving, we literally have Waymo running since 2019, and now expanding to even more cities but people refuse to acknowledge. Tesla has no lead in AI, not in software or hardware. if you listened to TSLA's latest earning call, there was also no mention of dojo, and instead they kept bringing up about buying NVDA H100 to build super computer. This throws out any vertical integration argument as well.

I know people still like to drink Musk coolaid but this is not going to end well. And before you think I am one sour grape because the stock went up 12%, do check my comment history. I insisted in buying calls for yesterday's earning. But that doesn't change the fact, that tesla is going to be a dead money for a while. It IS a well run car company, with no debt and state of art manufacturing. Their only MOAT is the tesla's supercharger network. It should get higher multiple than traditional car companies no doubt.

-Brad Gerstner a top advocate for AI today on cnbc mention his fund has a few short positions and trimmed some stakes in AI holdings.

-NVDA insiders have been consistently selling over the last year. All insiders at AI companies have been for that matter.

-SMCI didn't pre release earnings as they did before.

-NVDA delivery delays are shrinking.

-MCHP earnings were in line, didnt blow past expectations.

-INTC bombed on earnings

-AMD didnt blow past expectations

-ARM releases earnings this week, will see what their order flow looks like.

-ASML orders took a dive.

-Buffet sold some Apple, doenst seem to be phased by their AI initiatives.

-Even Meta mentioned their new goal is AI metaverse software development. Seems they got all the chips they need. They also lowered guidance going forward.

-These earnings are crucial for NVDA, this could determine the next steps for the AI cycle.

-Theres also growing competition in chip developments, seems every company(Apple, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc) are making their own chips for custom use.

I just dont think there is an issue getting chip anymore. The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow. The 1 year honeymoon period may be over, AI spending needs to start adding to earnings. otherwise its a massive expense for alot of companies of buying the chips and spending a lot of money on electricity to run the machines.

2024-05-07,1715115718.0,Reddit shares soar 14% after company reports revenue pop in first earnings report,"Reddit shares rallied 14% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company released quarterly results for the first time since its IPO in March.

Heres how the company did:

Loss per share: $8.19 loss per share. That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG

Revenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG

Revenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.

Digital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Metas ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.

Reddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.

For the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.

Reddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the companys CEO. 

We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit, Huffman said in a release Tuesday.

Reddit began trading under the ticker symbol RDDT on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddits private market valuation reached $10 billion.

The stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.

The company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.

Day trading is doing more than three trades in a ""rolling"" 5 day period. What exactly does that mean? I assume this means if I make a trade on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, does that mean I can't make even one trade until Monday, and even then, only one trade, because it hasn't been five days since the Tuesday and Wednesday trade? This is really just something for my curiosity since I plan to use a cash account.

Anyway, for my next questions, since I'm using a cash account... What is the difference between day trading and freeriding?

For example, if I'm using a cash account, can't I buy a stock and sell it the same day, since cash accounts are allowed to day trade? But if I do that, then the cash wouldn't be settled since there's a T+3 settlement period, so that would be freeriding, wouldn't it?

2024-07-13,1720880136.0,Is Reddit the Perfect stock? ,"I've noticed I use google search.  But when I do, I always add + reddit to see what the majority is voting on a legit answer. 

  
When I google things, I usually get an article, but I don't know if its slanted one way or another.  

One reddit, while we can't fact check everything there are very KNOWLEDGEABLE people on here and if they post technical content usually others will chime in to verify or criticize it.

  
Plus it's more real time, when news hits people respond.  I have found SO MANY stock plays early from 'experts' chiming in on a news story....then usually the good ones panic and delete their message because they realized they spilled too much info.

  
Intel appears to be that one, we've had some ASML peeps chime in saying they are going all in Intel after working with them on their new order.  That is a powerful message and they described with complete accuracy how Intel will start to carve its way in to the race.  Now a lot of those messages got deleted, so you needed to scan quickly to see it. 

  
Just one example, in the medical field we have doctors commenting on new techniques or tech they are using.  If the company is public you can start to search it out.  

TMDX was one and same with PRCT (many users pumped PRCT first).

  
What else do we have besides reddit? It's a complete treasure trove for hedge funds. Some niche forums (like Ferrari, Rolls Royce etc) have good content as usually you can verify their wealth and what they are buying.  Oddly enough in those forums NVDA is being bought like hot cakes still.  So they don't have any good under the radar picks.  



Those asking where they next stock play is...GET OUT OF THIS FORUM. Search whatever industry you like and see what the users are talking about!

2024-07-15,1721009504.0,Sofi appears to be breaking out ,"The stock market just gave us the green light on Sofi. I have seen this type of movie play out too many times. I'm no technical analysis expert and I don't know most of what the terms mean, but I can intuitively see patterns from seeing this type of movie play out so many times.

1. The stock market often times appears to treat individual stocks with a herd mindset. When a stock finally breaks out, everyone jumps on. You have seen this play out so many times. Hims, Robinhood, and even Apple's reversal fro m$170 to $230 which has no business trading at such valuation. It seems like a stock stays beaten down, until the stock market collectively decides ""ok it's this stocks turn to have it's moment of glory"". I saw this happen last year with lyft, with google, with draftkings, with carvana, and this year with apple. And many more examples I cant remember off the top of my head.
2. Momentum and trend reversal is very real. This is the type of stock where you try to time the bottom, you miss the bottom and think it will fall again, and then it ends up never looking back.  Again, I don't know much about technical analysis, but Sofi seems to have broke out of its slump. It has been setting off higher highs and lower lows.
3. Sofi has a odd price movement that 100% mimics and reacts to rate cut news. Go and see what happened to the stock when the market was expecting 5 rate cuts for 2024. Well, it seems like we have booked 1 rate cut for the year, and sofi rocketed up this last week. Momentum is a real phenomenon and usually when a stock breaks out, it doesn't end there. The story around sofi and other small cap stock have shifted.
4. To expand on point #3. The stock market follows themes. Every once in a while we get a shift in theme. Right now, the theme has shifted that there will be a rotation into small caps. and therefore the narrative around sofi has shifted. In the short term, market doesn't care about fundamentals or p/e ratios or any of that. Right now, Sofi is a beaten down stock and the narrative has shifted. Its a ""relatively undervalued"" stock that has taken a beat down and of course the market makers will run it up, and the WSB'ers will follow.
5. The market makers like to run up an under the radar stock and bring in all the WSB'ers. More options buying/selling. More profits. You see this theme over and over and over again. Rivian was at $20 last year. Then it crashed and burned. Then they pulled it back out of the grave and now everyone is talking about rivian again, when nothing fundamental has changed.

This stock may run up to $7.5 or $8 ahead of earnings in 2 weeks. And may result in $9 or $10 with a surprise beat or guidance raise. They already raised full year guidance last earnings call, but somehow the market didn't like that they lowered guidance for this specific quarter. Makes no sense.

Disclosure: I used to own sofi, until I sold for a $15k loss two months ago due to opportunity cost. I always knew it would bounce back, and with dumb luck I more than made up for it. However, I may consider buying call options tomorrow, since the wash out period has ended and I can claim the loss on my taxes for the previous loss, and I can re-enter the stock again.

2024-08-05,1722859834.0,Global Asset Bust | Yen Carry Trade Unwind Explainer,"# Background

A yen carry trade is a popular currency trading strategy that involves borrowing money in Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing it in assets or currencies with higher yields. Here are the key aspects of a yen carry trade:

1. Mechanism: Investors borrow yen at Japan's low interest rates and convert it to another currency, typically investing in higher-yielding assets like stocks, bonds, or currencies of countries with higher interest rates.
2. Popularity: The yen has been a favored currency for carry trades because Japan has maintained near-zero interest rates for over two decades to combat deflation.
3. Profitability: The strategy aims to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the target investment country. For example, borrowing at 0.5% in Japan and investing at 4% in the US could yield a 3.5% profit (before accounting for exchange rate fluctuations).
4. Risk: The main risk is exchange rate fluctuations. If the yen strengthens against the investment currency, it can erode or eliminate profits and potentially lead to losses.
5. Market impact: Large-scale yen carry trades can influence global financial markets. When the yen strengthens significantly, investors may rush to unwind their positions, potentially causing volatility in various asset classes, including equities.
6. Historical context: Yen carry trades have been partly blamed for contributing to market instability, such as during the 2008 financial crisis.
7. Current relevance: Recent strengthening of the yen and changes in Bank of Japan policy have led to speculation about the unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially affecting global markets, including US equities.

It's important to note that while yen carry trades can be profitable, they also carry significant risks and can have far-reaching effects on global financial markets.

# Relationship with Big Tech Stocks

The yen carry trade is a sophisticated financial strategy that involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets. This approach has gained popularity due to Japan's long-standing policy of maintaining near-zero interest rates to combat deflation. One common application of this strategy is selling yen to buy U.S. big tech stocks. 

To initiate a yen carry trade, a trader first borrows yen from a Japanese bank. Japan's low interest rates make borrowing yen an attractive option for investors seeking to leverage their investments. Once the yen is borrowed, the next step is to convert it into U.S. dollars. This can be accomplished through a currency exchange service or a forex trading platform. For instance, if a trader borrows 10 million yen at an interest rate of 0.1%, and the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 110 JPY, the trader would exchange the 10 million yen for approximately $90,909.With the U.S. dollars in hand, the trader then invests in U.S. big tech stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft, or Google. These companies are often chosen because they are expected to yield higher returns compared to the cost of borrowing the yen. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States, as well as the potential appreciation of the tech stocks. However, this strategy is not without risks. 

One significant risk is exchange rate fluctuation. If the yen appreciates against the dollar, the trader may incur losses when converting the dollars back to yen to repay the loan. Additionally, there is market risk, as the value of the U.S. tech stocks may decline, leading to potential investment losses. Furthermore, changes in interest rates in Japan or the U.S. can impact the profitability of the carry trade. For example, if U.S. interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing yen may become less attractive, reducing the potential gains from the investment.Recent market conditions have added another layer of complexity to the yen carry trade. The yen has been strengthening, and there are growing concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. This has led to a mass deleveraging, where investors sell assets, including U.S. tech stocks, to cover their losses and repay yen-denominated loans.

# Bank of Japan Raised Interest Rate to the 0.25 on July 31, 2024

[https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/)

# The Yen Carry Trade Unwind

The Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates to 0.25% has triggered a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy that has long influenced global financial markets.  This policy made the yen an attractive currency for carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets abroad, often including U.S. big tech stocks. The profitability of this strategy relies on the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries, as well as the relative stability of exchange rates.

The Bank of Japan's move to raise interest rates, although still low by global standards, signals a shift towards normalizing monetary policy. This change has profound implications for the yen carry trade. As the interest rate differential narrows, the profitability of the carry trade diminishes, prompting investors to unwind their positions.The unwinding process typically involves selling the assets purchased with borrowed yen and converting the proceeds back to yen to repay the loans. In the context of U.S. big tech stocks, which have been a favored destination for carry trade investments, this means large-scale selling of these equities. 

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, home to many of these big tech stocks, often experiences heightened volatility during such periods.The impact of this unwinding extends beyond just the stock market. As investors rush to close their positions, demand for yen increases, causing the currency to appreciate. This appreciation further accelerates the unwinding process, as it makes the carry trade even less profitable and potentially leads to losses for those who don't exit their positions quickly enough.The ripple effects of this unwinding can be felt across global financial markets. As large volumes of U.S. tech stocks are sold, it can lead to broader market selloffs. 

# Forced Selling

The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 0.25% has led to a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow yen at low-interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets. This unwinding is driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and substantial price drawdowns in the assets being sold off, particularly U.S. big tech stocks.

.The yen carry trade relies on the stability or depreciation of the yen and low-interest rates in Japan. Investors borrow yen at minimal costs, convert it to U.S. dollars, and invest in assets like U.S. big tech stocks, which offer higher returns. However, the recent appreciation of the yen and the narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. have made this strategy less profitable. As the yen strengthens, the cost of repaying yen-denominated loans increases, eroding the gains from investments in higher-yielding assets .The depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar has exacerbated the situation.

 When the yen appreciates, investors who borrowed in yen face higher costs when converting their returns back to yen to repay their loans. This scenario forces investors to unwind their positions to avoid mounting losses. The process of unwinding involves selling off the assets purchased with borrowed yen, such as U.S. big tech stocks, and converting the proceeds back to yen. This forced selling creates downward pressure on the prices of these assets, leading to significant price drawdowns.The large price drawdowns in U.S. big tech stocks are a direct consequence of this forced selling. As investors rush to liquidate their positions, the increased supply of stocks on the market drives prices down. This selloff is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying fundamentals of these companies but rather a reaction to the changing dynamics of the yen carry trade. 

The sharp declines in stock prices can trigger further selling as investors seek to cut their losses, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of declining asset prices and rising yen value. The broader implications of the yen carry trade unwinding are significant. The forced selling of U.S. big tech stocks can lead to increased volatility in global financial markets. As these stocks are widely held and influential in major indices, their price movements can impact market sentiment and investor behavior across various asset classes. Additionally, the appreciation of the yen can have ripple effects on other currencies and markets, as investors adjust their positions in response to the changing exchange rate environment.

# TLDR;

The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike to 0.25% has triggered a substantial unwinding of the yen carry trade, driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and significant price drawdowns in the assets being sold off. This forced selling has led to increased volatility in U.S. big tech stocks and broader financial markets, highlighting the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the far-reaching consequences of changes in monetary policy.",wallstreetbets,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ekm6al/global_asset_bust_yen_carry_trade_unwind_explainer/,Other,POSITIVE,0.5843065977096558

Wait a minute, there is another strange thing in the tables above. In the latest results, #NVIDIA declares:

* 18.8bn$ of future inventory commitments
* 10.6bn$ of future non-inventory commitments
* TOTAL 29.4bn$

This means that #NVIDIA increased the orders with its suppliers to produce GPUs only by 16.7% while total future commitments increased by 42%. What about inventory orders compared to one year ago? They grew from 7.24bn$ to 18.8bn$ or TWO-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE PERCENT

Wait a minute, by how much did #NVIDIAs Computer and Networking revenues grow over the past year? 404%&

Basically, #NVIDIA pretends us to believe that:

* Its clients purchase in big sizes never asking for a discount (and do not forget \~50% of the total revenues come from just 4 names: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta)
* Its suppliers continue producing at the same costs over the years despite the boom in order

So clearly the laws of demand and supply do not apply to #NVIDIA unless& the company keeps rebates to clients and production costs increases by its suppliers off-the-book to keep showcasing unrealistic margins in the same way they did, and got fined for, in the aftermath of the dotcom bust: [NVIDIA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/is-nvda-currently-employing-the-same-accounting-trick-to-inflate-its-margins-it-was-previously-caught-using-during-the-dot-com-bubble/)

2- #Coreweave buys (overpriced) #NVIDIA GPUs.

3- #Coreweave raises financing using #NVIDIA GPUs as collateral. What do they do with that? They buy more #NVIDIA GPUs, of course&

4- Meanwhile #Microsoft signs a deal with #Coreweave worth billions for future use of a cloud infrastructure #Coreweave didnt even begin to build yet while #Microsoft is, at the same time, loading on #NVIDIA GPUs for Azure that technically is a #Coreweave competitor?!

2024-08-28,1724848741.0,NVIDIAs next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.,"NVIDIAs current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU.

Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA.

To justify significant increase in NVIDIAs stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending.

2024-08-28,1724887395.0,Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.

Here is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected
Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected
Nvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.

Revenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.

Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 

Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.

Revenue in Nvidias data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.

Not all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the companys networking products.

Much of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidias chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Many customers are waiting for Nvidias next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell.

2024-08-29,1724891503.0,Short term Nvidia call holders- it's over. ,"Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.

No, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. 

Again, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. 

What I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. 

Positions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. 

TL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further.

3.  Lower net profit margin
The company still has super high net profit margin but in q2 its a bit lower than last quarter and it will go down next quarter too since tsmc has increased  manufacturing cost. 

4. Buyback 
It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. 

5. Seasonal short month
September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but theres a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? 

This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out! But I succeed to make a profit from nvidia 3x inverse when it hit $140 and also nvidia x3 leverage when It hit $90 lately.

2024-08-29,1724962159.0,"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.","Hi regards,

This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops.

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.

The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.

First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"".

|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL|230|1,4|164|
|MSFT|413|2,95|140|
|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|
|META|516|5,16|100|
|AMZN|171|1,26|135|
|NVDA|116|0,68|170|

As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.

But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.

## AAPL

Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.

How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.

But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.

## MSFT

They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.

They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.

They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?

## AMD

I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.

Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.

Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.

And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.

## META

They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.

ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.

## AMZN

The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.

# NVDA

AND OUR STAR CHILD.
HOT TOPIC OF 2024.
THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.

So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.

Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?

H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.

And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.

Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.

2024-08-31,1725116064.0,What if Warren Buffett is winding up Berkshire Hathaway? ,"Berkshire Hathaway stock selling is been assumed to be because he's fallen out of love with certain stocks (Apple) or because he wants to build up a cash reserve to take advantage of a predicted crash in the market but what if he's selling up to sell up? Berkshire Hathaway is a company that core competencies has increasingly been overshadowed by its CEOs investment gains in partially owned stock - its price going up on the news that its holding so much in T-bills shows how the price might be being distorted by ""buffett magic."" Market confidence that he can predict a change in the market and that he will be able to time that and exploit it for higher profit with a large cash reserve buoying the price even if the underlying value hasn't change.  $277 billion is an insane amount of cash to hand and it being news probably wouldn't boost the share value for many other CEOs or companies if the source was the same.

If you're a value investor that should concern you- maybe it concerns him as well- if his value is tied up in Hathaway stock and Hathaway stock is overpriced based on his own continued existence what happens to the stock value when he hands over the company, or dies? Would the market react the same way to learning that Greg Abel has $277bn in cash reserves to potentially invest with? Any other company can fall back on its business model to show potential future revenue when the CEO moves on- but the market value of Berkshire Hathaway stock is no longer in the business model of the companies it runs as a conglomerate- its in only having paid a single dividend since 1965 and reinvesting that money wherever they could if the business they directly controlled couldn't take the investment and Warren and Charlie being able to pick more winners than losers.

His business partner of 60 years died last year, he's 94 years old, he's a value investor- instead of cashing out of the stock market because he's eager for another round of further investments what if he continues cashing out all of the partially owned businesses that have so overshadowed the core business in the last couple of decades so he can spin off the operating parts of Berkshire Hathaway into businesses that's value isn't at least partially dependent on him living forever as its CEO? Either that or just selling all the partially owned stock that doesn't fall under the conglomerate and paying out a monster dividend so that when he goes and the slight mania of annual shareholder meetings dies down there is still a core value-focused business there to focus on. The guy who he's picked to replace him is much more of a CEO type than an investment management type- was an energy CEO for a company Berkshire bought out in the 2000s. 

What would you do if this was the case? If he was unwinding his whole market position for at least all the partially owned stock?

Its been like printing money for them.  

The kicker?  
As the yen kept falling, these guys got to enjoy even lower debt costs. Easy money, right?

But heres the twistJapan finally hiked rates for the first time in a decade, and the yen is starting to bite back. Buffetts now trimming his Apple stake, and some think its because his yen bet might be going south. So, whos still playing this game big time, and how do we stick it to them if the yen suddenly pops? Remember, this could be the mother of all squeezes if things flip.

2024-05-15,1715800739.0,Dell surges 9% on optimism it has secured big AI server orders ,"Dell shares rose more than 9% on Wednesday to an all-time high after Morgan Stanley raised its price target and predicted that the company would rake in sales from the insatiable demand for artificial intelligence servers.

Dell is seeing accelerating momentum, especially in winning business to build AI servers, unlocking a new bull case for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note on Wednesday. He upgraded his price target on Dell from $128 per share to $152 a share and called it a top pick.

All-in, we are hearing about more AI server momentum at Dell than at any other OEM, Woodring wrote, saying that he expected about $10 billion of AI server revenue in the companys fiscal 2025  ending next February.

Wednesdays move was the largest since March 1, when the stock surged after earnings showed that the computer manufacturer has benefited from the AI boom.

Dell shares are now up over 95% in 2024, trailing the 220% gain from rival AI servermaker Super Micro Computer but surpassing Hewlett Packard Enterprises 5% gains this year.

Most AI servers are built around Nvidias chips, which have become prized in the technology industry because they are used to deploy advanced AI models from companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta. Dell sells servers using the newest Nvidia AI chips, including its H100 GPU and the latest Blackwell-generation chips.

At Nvidias annual conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to send customers who want the latest AI chips to Dell for orders.

Youre going to need an AI factory, Huang said. And nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.

Michael [Dell] is here and hes happy to take your order, Huang continued.

While the near-exponential ramp of Nvidia GPU shipments and AI servers builds make it difficult to pin down exact growth rates, Woodring wrote, he has confidence in Dells business for various reasons. Among those reasons are the strengthening demand for AI servers and that he models Dells market share increasing.

He wrote that Dell may be able to upsell its customers and attach additional hardware, such as data storage.

Dell is expected to announce its April quarter earnings on May 30. Nvidia reports earnings for its quarter ending in April on May 22.

Dells other business, building PCs for consumers and businesses running Microsoft Windows, could get a boost next week when Microsoft reveals new capabilities at its conference, including long-awaited AI features that many analysts expect to drive demand for new PCs.

PC sales have slumped for two years in a post-pandemic hangover, as consumers and enterprises who bought new machines during 2020 and 2021 pushed back the timeline for their next upgrades.

But the PC industry is on course to grow again and is outperforming lowered expectations, Woodring wrote, which will benefit Dell.

We remain bullish on the PC market recovery as we are not only hearing about upgrade/refresh demand in our recent CIO and VAR checks, but also seeing upward revisions to notebook ODM builds in recent months, Woodring wrote.

 \*\*Key Point/ Secret Sauce First, Disclaimer, TLDR, additional comments/DD, sources at end\*\*

**Key Point/ Secret Sauce:**

Were all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, its a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations& \[1\]

More and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \[2\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \[3\], WEF \[4\], Yale \[5\]& etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power. 

SMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (youll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor. 

IMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \~$3b. This cost would later balloon to \~$9b, of which the government would help with about 50%. At worst lets say the first round cost $10b and no government funding. This has always been the largest hurdle to nuclear power plant development, upfront costs.

2024-08-05,1722818664.0,The Buffett Indicator. Is Warren Buffett correct this time round?,"Currently, the market is experiencing a surge in bearish sentiment, especially after Berkshire Hathaway announced changes in its second-quarter holdings over the weekend. This has left investors feeling anxious, even panicked. Remember when Berkshire reduced its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter? At the time, Warren Buffett told us it was purely for tax reasons and not because he had a negative view on Apple. He even emphasized that the iPhone is the greatest product ever and that Apple is an even better company than his long-term investments in American Express and Coca-Cola!

  But who would have thought that despite what Warren Buffett said, in the second quarter, Berkshire continued to sell Apple shares? Moreover, they expanded their sales, directly selling off 49.4% of their Apple holdings, which is approximately $75.5 billion worth of stock! Is this a case of saying one thing and doing another, or are tax considerations really that significant? There has been no response on this matter yet. While Berkshires largest holding was significantly sold off, its second-largest holding, Bank of America, also saw reductions starting in July, with continuous sales over 12 days amounting to 90 million shares, roughly worth $3.8 billion!

With these major sell-offs in its top two holdings, Berkshires cash reserves have surged to an all-time high of $276.94 billion. The most straightforward explanation is that holding large amounts of cash is a strategy for when we face a bear market correction, preparing for a significant downturn.

So, when Berkshire sells stocks to liquidate and holds massive cash reserves, it can be interpreted as Warren Buffett worrying about a potential U.S. stock market crash! A more accurate speculation might be that Apple, as an end-consumer electronics product company, is not just facing tax issues but might be suffering due to concerns about an impending U.S. economic recession. This could mean consumers will tighten their belts, leading to poor sales of consumer electronics. Therefore, Buffetts actions also echo what was discussed in last Saturdays article: nothing is scarier than an economic recession, and Buffett is preparing for one!

Buffetts large-scale stock sales align with his past operating principles and logic. The most famous example is the Buffett Indicator, which is the ratio of the total stock market value to GDP. This ratio has surged above 180% again in recent periods, indicating that the market is highly overvalued! The last time it exceeded 180%, it even soared to 200% before eventually crashing in the bear market of 2022=É.

Therefore, returning to the 180% overheat level this time makes Buffett's massive stock sales seem reasonable. The reason for the overvaluation, as Ive mentioned before, is that the profit returns from AI havent kept pace with the skyrocketing stock prices. To maintain the same P/E ratio, either profits need to jump quickly, or stock prices need to correct downward, right?

=¨Of course, I want to remind everyone of two things. First, Warren Buffett is not always right, just like anyone else. Dont forget he sold TSMC ADR at around $72, which later soared to a high of $193 this year, meaning Buffett missed out on at least $6 billion in profit!

The second point is about the Buffett Indicator. When it previously broke through 180%, it continued to surge to 200% before the upward trend truly ended. This means the indicator doesnt necessarily crash right after breaking 180%. It can easily become overheated and sluggish! Therefore, it should only be used as a reference to judge whether the stock market is overvalued. If used as a direct basis for selling, it could result in selling too early. Its essential to also consider other economic data for a more comprehensive analysis!

2024-07-21,1721530745.0,Why I am Buying Calls on Lululemon (LULU),"Hello Everyone,

This is my second DD, trying to go 2/2. First one was on Global Payments (GPN). Continuing with the oversold strategy. And this time, I will be going for LULU. Here are my notes from my research and why I think the pros outweigh the cons. Please let me know if there are factors I have missed or am overlooking.

  
LULU Price as of 7/20 - $280.24

My Position - 1/17/25 - $400 Call @ $5.50, wish I bought the 3/21/2025 $400 Call @ $6.75. But it is what it is.
Update - After all the constructive criticism lets call it. I sold the 1/17/25 call @5.00 and will wait to buy at the 250ish area

- Board Approved $1 billion in buybacks on June 6 showing confidence from within the company.

- Beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates for Q1, however issued weak guidance for Q2. 

- Stock is down 45% from all time highs, despite showing consistent growth in revenue and profits. Leading me to believe weak guidance is factored in. Also nearing/at key support levels.

- 5 Year RSI is below 30 indicating oversold. Which it has respected for the most part so far.

- Barely scratched the surface in the men's department, which has been a major boost for sales and expected to continue on this path.

- Almost all reviews of the product show positive feedback on the quality (from men/women), and margins have continued to grow consistently.

- Making about $10 billion in revenue per year with a market cap of only $34 billion.

- P/E ratio at all time lows, despite company being in a better position than ever before. Can be arguable but without a doubt not at its worst point.

- Total Debt of only $1.4 billion which is relatively low.

- Demand is still strong and profits are expected to grow faster than revenue.

- Continuing to open new stores in new markets adding to growth potential.

- 3% net revenue gain in Americas, but 35% internationally and expect this to continue to rise.

- Despite weaker guidance for Q2, the company is still projecting 10-11% growth for the year.  

- Almost every analyst/companies fair value estimate is $329 and above.

- International business (only accounts for 21% of business) is underpenetrated and shows long runway for growth.

- Operating Margins are unmatched by competitors such as Nike and On Holdings.

- Fears about competitors catching up.

- China/US relations and the uncertainty between the two could be bad for business.

- Revenue growth rate is going down however this is typical as revenue grows the growth rate usually goes down. Apple would be a prime example.

- Chief Product Officer left and announced overhauling its product and brand teams.  

- Concerns about the company having a low moat.

- Softness in the U.S. market and planned increased spending to grow brand awareness have resulted in a weaker outlook. Don't see increased spending to grow brand awareness as a negative especially during an Olympics year.

2024-07-30,1722338962.0,"10K AAPL right now, hold 18 months","# Why

I believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis and stock is already reflecting the AI hype around Apple Intelligence, but not the earnings and the impact of the tech when it actually releases for the public. 18 months is the time in which I believe there will be a positive impact reflected back into the stock price. 

# Diversification

Apple saw an increase in services revenue of 3B every year, and it can only grow. The main difference now is that there is AI and a better overall experience that can be sold at a higher price than usual. I can see how they will try to implement a better paywalled AI around the release of iOS 19, boosting other services with an Apple One pack. 

# No one upgrades, except this time

Older iPhones are not AI capable, and everyone that wants the new toy will have a reason to upgrade, the first real reason to upgrade since the iPhone X release. 



Not to mention the countless memes we will get, 2008 style dumb Siri videos. Unrelated, but can't wait for it.   




All considered I think they will get a huge boost in revenue, more fidelization and better diversification. Stock will grow, maintaining trajectory, good for investors.

2024-07-31,1722416876.0,"Are NVIDIA's AI chips still ""so good that even when the competitors chips are free, its not cheap enough,"" as Jensen Huang said in March? ","TL;DR: Probably yes (just my opinion)...

On Monday, July 29, Apple Research [published the scientific background of its ""Apple Foundation Model""](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/apple-intelligence-foundation-language-models) (AFP). According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...

According to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\*).

One of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\*).

According to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be ""so good"". And I haven't done this calculation for the upcoming Blackwell generation...

Firstly lets address the elephant in the room, my previous Walmart, Snapchat, and shorting of SPY did not go to what I planned. Secondly, Id like to say on the allegations. I have read more books than last time, I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and I have a greater understanding of quadrants and business money lets begin.

I believe we must short The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC). Let me say thirdly, I am not a financial adviser I cannot advise you. Okay lets begin. Some need to know information to begin. The Kraft Heinz Company produces many products, the most important to the world is mustard. This is quite the coincidence because in 2 days on August 3rd international mustard day will take place. This is not a coincidence. This is an opportunity. My plan is to buy short positions onto craft tomorrow on the 2nd than wait until the 4th when the stock will shoot down in value and then sell right after international mustard day on the 3rd.

Lets talk about this in 3 parts. The fundamentals like the money. The observationals like the stuff you see. Thirdly, the investor sentience. Lets talk financial papers. A market cap of 43.986B. Thats kind of low for the amount of table products they produce. Mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, the list goes on. Any table product you see is made by them. I personally have a market cap goal of 200B they should be valued like Microsoft. They are the Microsoft of customary dressings. Lets talk Observationals. When I say this is the worst company ever I mean it. They produce everything you apply to your food during dinner yet they somehow manage to not have a physical location? Even Apple has physical locations. If they want to start making real money the Heinz Kraft group needs to create physical stores to cell there products I dont understand how they expect to get to a 200B market cap without them. Lets reroute. They have no plans to open stores. Bad business leads to bad profits. Short bus incoming! Discussion of investor sentience. How do I check investor sentience? I only know my own sentience and my buddies sentience at best. I have been looking all over the internet for measurements and resources to check sentience but I am out of luck most of the time. I dont even know the CEOs sentience or the workers sentience. These are important things. I get unrelated articles when looking up investor sentience information.

Lets cut the case. KHC goes down my money goes up. I am taking short positions in this company. I am not adviser but do as I say not as I do once said by Kodak. 

TLDR/Summary/Explanation/Conclusion: The goals of the KHC group are not in the right places. No physical locations, to low market cap, no sentience that Im aware of. I am taking short positions tomorrow before international mustard day, holding through, than selling August 4th.

A fund is essentially a big pot of money that professional investors trade with to make money for everyone. If you add your money into the pot you get to share in the winnings if there are any. 

Mutual funds are actively monitored so theres a little bit of a fee (expense ratio), and ETFs are usually passively managed so the fee is smaller. 

Lets say you have $100 to invest. You could buy one stock in some random company, or could keep saving up until you can afford a popular stock like Apple or something. 

Or instead, you could invest that in a fund. And maybe 10% of your money goes towards Apple, 10% goes towards Amazon etc. 

Its a way for you to diversify without needing tons of money. And you can check the portfolio of any fund and find some that invest in companies or industries you like.

2024-09-16,1726517905.0,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsingers effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to evaluate independent sources of funding, and comes days after Intels board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone operating board and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand, Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intels quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidias general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the companys 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMCs forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMCs 3nm process are shipping now in Apples iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio thats currently under construction.

All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because thats the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know were capable of achieving, Gelsinger said.

2024-03-28,1711639443.0,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Teslas Model 3, as price wars heat up in Chinas fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country  a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Teslas Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 32s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomis car factory, for which all key steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan under 500,000 yuan ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Teslas Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYDs Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nios ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpengs P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekrs 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apples Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Teslas Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the companys Full Self Driving for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the Max version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsches Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomis recently launched Human x Car x Home strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the companys revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020  and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicles exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

2024-03-31,1711920499.0,TKO - Owning  UFC and WWE could net you a FCF yield of 7-9% at current stock price. ,"First discussion Im posting here.  Hope you benefit from it.  As a warning it will be mostly point form.  Valuation is at the end if you want the TLDR.  Here goes. 

TKO group describes themselves as a premium sports and entertainment company that comprises the UFC and WWE.   

On September 12, 2023 Endeavour group (the then owner of UFC) and WWE closed a transaction to combine the two entities to form a new, publicly listed company (TKO group holdings).  Endeavour Group Holding (also publicly traded btw) remains majority shareholder with 51% of outstanding shares. 

Unfortunately, there is not much data that I could find on the combined group.  Financials that I found cover only January 1, 2023  December 31, 2023 for UFC and September 12, 2023  December 31, 2023 for the combined WWE and UFC.  Parent financials for are available for through Endeavour Group Holdings dating back only to 2021.  WWE financial reports are available back to 2000 as it was a separate publicly traded company.

History:
Both the UFC and WWE are household names and represent the most well recognized franchises in combat sports and wrestling entertainment respectively.  Additionally, both companies have long operating histories.  For reference the UFC just celebrated its 30th anniversary having hosted its first fight in 1993 and will be celebrating the UFC 300 event this coming April.  The WWE dates back even further, tracing its origins back to the 1950s being founded by either the father or grandfather of the well-known (and now somewhat infamous) figurehead Vince McMahon according to Wikipedia. 

About the business:
Under the new combined company the UFC and WWE will operate us separate entities.  The UFC will led by Dana White, who has served as president of the UFC since 2001 and grown it to a multibillion dollar business.  The WWE being led by Nick Kahn who joined the  WWE in 2020 and took over the role of President in 2021.

Per their 10K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 TKO group generates revenue from principal activities:

1. Media rights and content.
2. Live events.
3. Sponsorship.
4. Consumer products licensing.

1. Media and content:
TKO generates revenue from licensing live events and original programming to broadcasters domestically and internationally that carry TKO programming on digital and linear channels as well as pay-per-view.

These contracts last 35 years with broadcasters but they have some significant agreements lasting 710 years.

Broadcasters that have contracts with WWE or UFC include: ESPN, ABC, Comcast, Fox, Peacock, Tencent, Sony, Warner Brothers and now Netflix. 

Programming includes long and short for content, reality, series, and other filmed entertainment. Furthermore, TKO not only sells to distributors but also sells direct to consumers through UFC fight pass and WWE network.

2. Live events:
Live events generate revenue generation through ticket sales, site, fees, travel packages, and VIP experiences.

Between WWE and UFC generate 350 annual live events per year

3. Sponsorships:
TKO generates ad revenue and sponsorship revenue from sale of in-venue and in broadcasting advertising assets and digital impressions.

Ad revenues are driven by original content on third party social media platforms. For example, WWE has 100 million subscribers on YouTube and is the 12th most followed channel.

TKO group also has partnerships with major brands, including Anheuser-Busch, Draft Kings, GM, P",stocks,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bslgkz/tko_owning_ufc_and_wwe_could_net_you_a_fcf_yield/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9926948547363281
2024-04-03,1712165234.0,"Disney wins proxy fight with Peltzs Trian, as shareholders reelect full board ","Disney shareholders on Wednesday reelected the media conglomerates full board, preliminary results show, handing a stinging defeat to activist Nelson Peltz and former Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter, both of whom agitated for change at one of Americas most storied companies.

The widely expected victory caps a combative months-long process and affirms the boards decisions, from the move to bring back CEO Bob Iger to his efforts to re-invigorate the $223 billion media company. Peltz and Trian wanted to oust two directors  Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael Froman  citing sustained share underperformance, a failed succession process, and billions in misdirected investments.

A second activist, Blackwells, also failed to win board seats in its own long-shot bid.

Disney deployed significant resources in the proxy fight. The company called in support from its founding family, Star Wars creator George Lucas, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Pixar and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.

The company also spent an estimated $40 million fighting off Peltz. The full-court press worked. Disneys two largest shareholders, Vanguard and Blackrock, reportedly decided to back management in the final days before Wednesdays meeting.

Ultimately, the activist failed to convince enough retail or institutional shareholders that he had a meaningful plan to fix the House of Mouse. While Peltzs candidacy picked up meaningful support from proxy advisors and smaller institutional investors, shareholders were less compelled by former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated to the board.

2024-04-10,1712790600.0,Spotify (SPOT): $60B valuation on hopes of profitability for 2024.,"I love Spotify as a product and have been an investor since Q1 of 2022. In my opinion, it offers a superior user experience and is better value for money than competing services  even with recent price increases. I'm a big fan of founder and CEO Daniel Ek; he's proven himself as an exceptional innovator and leader by building Spotify into the industry powerhouse it is today. While Spotify is a household name, I don't think the average person fully grasps just how remarkable the company's success story is.  Against giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google, Spotify has not only held its ground over the years, but has consistently expanded its lead within the incredibly competitive music streaming world.

In early 2022, Spotify stock fell below pre-pandemic levels and after extensive research, I felt it was highly undervalued and initiated a long-term position in March. I added throughout 2022 and early 2023, bringing my average to around $130 - equivalent to a valuation of around $26 Billion.

I bought intending to hold the stock 'forever', and I have conviction that the fundamentals of the business will continue to improve over the long term. However, I am surprised to see $SPOT's valuation reach \~$60B so soon; I didn't expect sentiment to change so significantly until the company had achieved both consistently positive operating margins (for 2 or 3 consecutive quarters at least), and continued revenue growth at these levels at least into 2025.

User growth has been strong, free cash flows have grown nicely, and management has shown that their strategy is to now prioritise profitability - but even so, I can't see myself adding at $300 per share.

I am very curious to hear thoughts and opinions on $SPOT at it's current price. Is anyone buying? if so, I'd appreciate if you could outline your reasoning. Likewise, if you're bearish, feel free to explain why.

Disney (DIS) is well-known globally for creating magical worlds and experiences for all their fans, having a long decorated history of significantly impacting the childhoods of kids worldwide. DIS clinched all 5 top spots for box office performance in 2019 ([SOURCE](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2019/)), as a testament to their ability to narrate engaging and captivating stories to a diverse audience globally. However, DIS has recently lost its magic with sub-par performance for its films, disappointing Direct To Consumer (DTC ) subscriber numbers, and a proxy battle with an activist investor. The future growth of DIS is unstable given that linear network which contributes about 15% of their revenue is rapidly phasing out and DIS is still hemorrhaging money on DTC.   


# Revenue:

Disney splits their business into 3 segments. Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences

***Linear Network***  
In the Dealbook Summit, Bob Iger believes that Linear Network is no longer part of the core business of DIS and should be running complimentary to other avenues of the business such as streaming.  
  
I dont believe Linear Networks will be present in the long run, Linear networks have a large price tag for consumers due to the long-standing price agreement between cable channels and cable distributors. On top of that, from an economic perspective, the investment into equipment required for both consumers and cable companies for Linear networks is significant so the price tag attached to Linear Networks will stay high. Compared to DTC which requires lesser investments.

2024-04-18,1713438380.0,TSMC beats first-quarter revenue and profit expectations on strong AI chip demand ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications.

Here are TSMCs first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected

Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected

TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion.

TSMC is the worlds largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients.

For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality, CFO Wendell Huang said during the firms earnings call Thursday.

CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a healthy growth year, supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base.

Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power, said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than double this year.

TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. 

Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMCs shares to surge 56% in the past one year.

TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC, Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results.

TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market.

TSMCs net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the companys history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMCs strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins, Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week.

Last year, TSMCs business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned.

Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake  its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces.

There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools, CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday.

EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors.

However, some wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with minimal impact to revenue.

The U.S. also recently granted TSMCs Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the worlds most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

2024-04-18,1713473248.0,"NBAs exclusive TV rights negotiating window with ESPN, Warner expected to pass without a deal","The National Basketball Associations exclusive media rights negotiating window with current partners Disney
 and Warner Bros. Discovery
 is likely to expire Monday without a new deal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beginning next week, the NBA will be able to work on agreements for new partners to show packages of games. Amazon
, Apple
, YouTube TV, Comcast
s NBCUniversal/Peacock and Netflix
have all had preliminary conversations with the league expressing potential interest, CNBC reported last year. The exclusive negotiating window with the leagues incumbent partners officially ends Monday.

While no agreement is expected to be announced by the deadline, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery both continue to work on terms with the league, an NBA spokesperson confirmed. The NBA would like to bring in at least one new partner to serve as a flagship streamer, CNBC reported last year. The league wants a robust streaming partner that will use marketing and reach to make the games a priority on their platform, CNBC reported.

We continue to have productive discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery on a renewal of our media deals, a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.

Spokespeople for Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.

Warner Bros. Discoverys TBS began airing NBA games in 1984, and TNT has shown NBA games since 1988. Disneys ESPN and ABC have broadcast the NBA since 2002. The two companies have both publicly expressed a desire to renew with the NBA and have joined forces with Fox to launch a new streaming service geared to sports fans that dont already pay for cable. That service will debut in the fall, the companies said earlier this year.

A more complex deal

The NBA is looking to double the $24 billion it generated from its previous media rights deal with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery by adding new partners and charging more for rights, CNBC reported last year. In 2014, during the NBAs last negotiation, the league renewed its rights with Disney and Time Warner about five months before the end of its exclusive negotiating window. The NBA also doubled the price for its rights in that deal from its previous agreement.

This time, the discussions with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are more complicated because of the likely addition of a third party. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery arent eager to lose the rights they already have. Still, the league is looking for a large increase in fees, and neither company wants to carry the full burden of paying significantly more for what they already have, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

That allows for the league to bring in another party  or possibly even two more. The NBA could sell its new in-season tournament package of games to a separate media company other than its primary new streaming partner, one of the people said.

The value of popular live sports programming has increased because of its value to advertisers. While ad-free subscription streaming services have increasingly become the home for popular scripted programming, sports are still predominantly watched live, forcing viewers to see commercials.

Last years NBA playoffs was the most watched in 11 years across TNT, ABC, ESPN and NBA TV, according to Nielsen. The 2023-24 NBA regular season averaged 1.09 million viewers, up 1% from last year and the highest across-network average in four years, according to SportsMediaWatch.

Still, regular-season viewership plateaued this year among standard cable and broadcast networks. Across ABC, ESPN and TNT, the average televised audience of 1.56 million was down 1% from last years 1.59 million and was the lowest in three years. TNT averaged 1.4 million viewers for its 65 regular-season games, equaling the year prior, according to a Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson.

The first round of the NBA playoffs will start Saturday.

Three major tech playersAsus, Lenovo and Microsofts Xboxare the first companies to confirm theyll be developing new devices that run the software. Most notably, Microsoft is teaming up with Meta to build a limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox, according to the announcement. Asus and Lenovo, on the other hand, are building headsets designed for specific use cases. Asus is developing a headset dedicated to gaming whereas Lenovo wants its device to be for productivity, learning, and entertainment.

The company says all future headsets can connect via the same Meta Quest app on iOS and Android. Plus, the Meta Quest Store, which the company renamed the Meta Horizon Store, is open to third-party developers, allowing them to use Metas frameworks and tools to create new mixed-reality experiences.

Meta Horizon OS is a strategic move for the company and comes at a time when the VR/AR headset wars between Meta, Apple and Sony continue to heat up.

2024-04-23,1713870699.0,Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes,"Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent ""efficiency"" strategy.

Over the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.

The audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, ""driven by share price appreciation during the quarter"", according to Spotify.

It also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates  3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.

On top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.

According to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise ""later this year."" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.

The stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.

The streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.

Gross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.

Spotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.

Revenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion)  20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.

User figures

Total monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter  but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.

Premium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million  a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.

Free cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.

The average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.

Profit pledge

Overall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.

Spotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.

Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.

That spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs  three in 2023 alone.

Spotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.

In addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of ""Call Her Daddy.""

The new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.

The audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.

Cooper's ""Call Her Daddy"" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.

2024-04-24,1713961964.0,Nintendo is an inevitable now  a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time,"Nintendo is an inevitable now  a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time. Better yet, with Nintendos IP flywheel finally in full effect, the earnings snowball you were first told about many years ago is not only rolling and getting bigger, but its set to accelerate as higher-powered hardware drops in the near term and the software release slate normalizes thereafter. 

Which brings us to another key reason to celebrate Nintendos fast-approaching through the looking glass moment: **It's not just about its dedicated videogame platform business. Nintendo has been taking steps to diversify its income streams for years outside of its core business of videogames by slowly and successfully monetizing its IP via theme parks, movies, and other capital-efficient avenues that are just now beginning to reveal themselves.** Its still early innings, mind you, but were happy to report that years of constant assertions that Nintendo would shy away from properly monetizing its gold-plated portfolio of unrivaled IP look positively ridiculous in hindsight. With the blockbuster success of the Super Mario movie, as well as its theme park and other IP-related initiatives approaching critical mass, Nintendo today has multiple sources of high incremental margin revenue that will begin to snowball over the next several years.  

To say the same thing a slightly different way, the quality and visibility of Nintendos business in early 2024 is radically superior and less risky relative to what it was at any point in its roughly 13-decade history, even if these structural improvements are not broadly appreciated as such. Furthermore, now that Nintendo is armed with the market-leading Switch platform and a self-sustaining IP flywheel on the far side of exit velocity, we remain more confident than ever about its efforts to properly leverage its Apple-like ecosystem of hardware, software, and services across its loyal, 122 million+ strong global customer base.  

**Let's recap why we think Nintendo is slowly but surely sending old bear arguments into permanent hibernation:** 

1. Nintendo just printed its highest TTM revenue and operating profit figures in the Switch platforms history, seven years into an aging console ""cycle,"" despite having released only two top-tier first-party system sellers over the previous 18 months.  
2. Nintendos Apple-like ecosystem (reinforced by a very Disney-like IP content flywheel) has radically improved the economic resiliency and visibility of Nintendos revenue and cash flow, de-cyclifying its earnings power in lockstep.  
3. With the release of the Switch 2, Nintendo is primed for continued massive margin expansion by reaching a previously untapped market for the companys consoles.

2024-04-25,1714015131.0,Meta's Reality Labs posts $3.85 billion loss in first quarter,"Meta shows no signs of substantially trimming its losses from investing in the metaverse, as competition heightens between the Facebook parent and Apple in the virtual reality market.

In its first-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Meta disclosed that its Reality Labs unit recorded a $3.85 billion operating loss. Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Metas total sales for the quarter.

Analysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.

Reality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse the next frontier, imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.

For now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.

The company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called spatial computing experience.

Meta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple basically won out in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Metas move aims to ensure the open model defines the next generation of computing.

2024-04-27,1714182190.0,Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,"Federal authorities say a critical safety gap in Teslas Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and many others resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Teslas Autopilot design has led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes, the NHTSA report said. The system did not sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.

NHTSAs filing pointed to a weak driver engagement system, and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isnt paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including nags or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.

The NHTSA findings are the most recent in a series of regulator and watchdog reports that have questioned the safety of Teslas Autopilot technology, which the company has promoted as a key differentiator from other car companies.

On its website, Tesla says Autopilot is designed to reduce driver workload through advanced cruise control and automatic steering technology.

Tesla has not issued a response to Fridays NHTSA report and did not respond to a request for comment sent to Teslas press inbox, investor relations team and to the companys vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy.

Following the release of the NHTSA report, Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a statement calling on federal regulators to require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature to the roads it was designed for.

On its Owners Manual website, Tesla warns drivers not to operate the Autosteer function of Autopilot in areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be present, among a host of other warnings.

We urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives, the senators said.  

Earlier this month, Tesla settled a lawsuit from the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two, who died in a crash when his Tesla Model X with Autopilot features switched on hit a highway barrier. Tesla has sought to seal from public view the terms of the settlement.

In the face of these events, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk signaled this week that they are betting the companys future on autonomous driving.

If somebody doesnt believe Teslas going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company, Musk said on Teslas earnings call Tuesday. He added, We will, and we are.

Musk has for years promised customers and shareholders that Tesla would be able to turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles with a software update. However, the company offers only driver assistance systems and has not produced self-driving vehicles to date.

He has also made safety claims about Teslas driver assistance systems without allowing third-party review of the companys data.

For example, in 2021, Elon Musk claimed in a post on social media, Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.

Philip Koopman, an automotive safety researcher and Carnegie Mellon University associate professor of computer engineering, said he views Teslas marketing and claims as autonowashing. He also said in response to NHTSAs report that he hopes Tesla will take the agencys concerns seriously moving forward.

People are dying due to misplaced confidence in Tesla Autopilot capabilities. Even simple steps could improve safety, Koopman said. Tesla could automatically restrict Autopilot use to intended roads based on map data already in the vehicle. Tesla could improve monitoring so drivers cant routinely become absorbed in their cellphones while Autopilot is in use.

Here are Samsungs first-quarter results versus LSEG estimates:

Revenue: 71.92 trillion Korean won (about $52.3 billion), vs. 71.04 trillion Korean won

Operating profit: 6.61 trillion Korean won, vs. 5.94 trillion Korean won

Samsungs revenue for the quarter ending March jumped 12.81% from a year ago, while operating profit soared 932.8% in the same period.

The figures were in line with the companys guidance earlier this month, where Samsung said operating profit in the January-March quarter likely rose to 6.6 trillion Korean won, up 931% from a year ago. The firm expected first quarter revenue at 71 trillion won.

The South Korean electronics giant saw record losses in 2023 as the industry reeled from a post-Covid slump in demand.

The company posted KRW 71.92 trillion in consolidated revenue on the back of strong sales of flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones and higher prices for memory semiconductors. Operating profit increased to KRW 6.61 trillion as the Memory Business returned to profit by addressing demand for high value-added products, Samsung Electronics said in a statement on Tuesday.

Citi analysts said they see upside for Samsungs NAND flash memory business as a result of AI computing demand. In a note on April 5, they reiterated their buy rating on the firm with a target price of 120,000 won  a 56% upside from the closing price of 76,700 won on Monday.

NAND is another staple memory chip alongside DRAM.

We expect storage (HDD) to be the next bottleneck in AI computing, especially in AI training, and foresee Samsung Electronics to be one of the key beneficiaries of SSD demand momentum for AI training, said the Citi analysts.

Samsung is the worlds largest manufacturer of dynamic random-access memory chips (DRAM), which are commonly found in a wide range of consumer devices including smartphones and computers.

Samsung said it expects the second quarter to be driven mostly by demand for generative AI, while mobile demand remains stable. Meanwhile, it expects PC demand to be impacted by slow seasonality, which could lead to customers adjusting inventories before new product launches in the second half of 2024.

In a Tuesday earnings call, the firm warned of escalating geopolitical instability and continued cost hikes in major components, particularly memory.

The Omaha-based conglomerate shed a total of 5.8 million BofA shares in separate sales on Friday, Monday and Tuesday for almost $228.7 million at an average selling price of $39.45 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The latest action extended Berkshires selling streak to 12 consecutive sessions, matching the 12 consecutive sessions from July 17 to Aug. 1.

Berkshire has sold more than 174.7 million shares of the Charlotte-based bank for $7.2 billion, with 858.2 million shares remaining, or 11.1% of shares outstanding. BofA has fallen to the No.3 spot on Berkshires list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshires second biggest holding.

Moynihan on Buffett

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofAs preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The Oracle of Omaha then added 300 million more shares to his bet around 2018 and 2019.

2024-08-04,1722790351.0,My thoughts on META,"**I'd like to start a dialogue on what investors think about META - please challenge or add onto this discussion. This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see",stocks,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ejzv3k/my_thoughts_on_meta/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9994857311248779

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Then Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.

2024-08-06,1722977677.0,Getting a gut check on INTC,"YTD INTC is down about 58.5% as of last check and in the short run it's outlook looks terrible especially given the negative press with their core product desktop CPUs.

However I can't help but draw parallels to how AMD was looking about 10 years ago trading for under $2 and now for roughly $130. 

In some ways I feel Intel has a much better potential to bounce back than even AMD did. 

Chief of which being how incredibly wide their business is. 
While AMD is chiefly focused on CPUs and GPUs, Intel has both plus a much stronger presence in wireless chips, storage hardware, the USB patent and may others that AMD does / did not have. In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. 

Plus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. 

This seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And
AMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. 

However, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. 

I keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. 

Note, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. 


Edit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. 

I feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon. Is the opportunity cost of buying and holding now or even buying long term call options worth it compared to just holding the cash in a money market or investing in SPY?

2024-08-07,1723054415.0,Warren Buffett now owns more T-bills than the Federal Reserve ,"Berkshire Hathaway now owns more in Treasury bills than the U.S. Federal Reserve as Warren Buffett builds up his cash fortress to a record level.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate held $234.6 billion in short-term investments in Treasury bills at the end of the second quarter, while it owned more than $42 billion of cash and cash equivalents that included T-bills with maturities of three months or less, according to its quarterly financial report.

That compared with $195.3 billion in T-bills that the Fed owned as of July 31. The central bank held $4.4 trillion in Treasury securities that include notes, bonds and inflation-linked securities. The Fed was a big buyer of the governments debt during the pandemic and is always one of the largest holders of Treasurys as part of its effort to keep liquidity in the markets.

Buffett, 93, pulled off a surprising and yet prescient move by selling big chunks in stock holdings including Apple last quarter, ahead of a drastic global sell-off this week. Berkshire has been a seller of stocks for seven quarters straight, but that selling accelerated in the last period with Buffett shedding more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter.

Many loyal Buffett watchers viewed the decision to dump his top holdings as a wake-up call with the Oracle of Omaha seemingly turning bearish on the economy and the markets.

Buffett has noted in the past during times of crisis that hell buy Treasury bills directly at auction. The government sells T-bills for terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.

Buffetts gigantic war chest has been earning sizeable returns thanks to the pop in Treasury yields over the past two years. If invested in 3-month Treasury bills at about 5%, $200 billion in cash would generate about $10 billion a year, or $2.5 billion a quarter.

After the Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, the central bank bought about $5 trillion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds to help aid the economy. But the Fed has been shrinking its asset holdings since June 2022, in a program widely known as quantitative tightening.

The Fed seeks to promote maximum employment and stable prices by independently setting monetary policy. It includes buying and selling Treasury securities held by the public to control the money supply and interest rates.

2024-08-09,1723201885.0,TSMC sales grow 45% in July on strong AI chip demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.

Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.

Taiwans biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Its also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the worlds largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.

TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMCs revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.

Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidias development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

TSMCs 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.

- Charles Shum, analyst

Click here for the research.

Worries about the global economic outlook over the past week interrupted the AI rally that had seen key players like TSMC gains billions in market value. Investors opted to cash out of some of the years biggest gainers, pushing TSMCs shares down 10% in a day, though the company recovered much of that in subsequent days as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.

2024-08-11,1723385531.0,"AppLovin is an interesting company, but I'm somewhat on the fence.","AppLovin operates a mobile gaming company with hundreds of millions of daily active players and a software company, which was started in 2012. The company works as follows: The software division offers a marketplace, among other less important services, where companies can advertise on their apps, and other companies can place ads for their apps. These desired ads are then sorted by an in-house AI called ""Axon,"" which ensures the ads reach the appropriate viewers.

What makes this AI special is that it is fed with data from 700 million mobile gamers, which, according to the company, makes it very effective.

The software division is currently growing by about 50% annually, and in the last quarter, revenue grew by 37%.

Naturally, AppLovin has very good margins, with a gross margin of 70% and a net income margin of 20%. I also foresee growth in the net income margin through cost-cutting.

In the mobile app ad business, AppLovin is well-regarded despite large competitors like Google, and it is used by many developers, overshadowing other providers like Unity.

The CEO is also the founder and holds a significant number of shares. It's also positive for shareholders that the company is buying back shares2.5% last year and 6.6% TTM.

However, as I mentioned, there are also negative points:

I have studied the company for a long time and found some things that I don't find ideal for an investment. Regarding ad publishers, I've seen studies showing that companies make more money when they advertise through Google's program (AdMob) than with AppLovin. I've also seen many reviews where people described how their AppLovin account, which they used to run ads on their apps, was suddenly banned without any notice or warning.

In itself, I don't believe these individual issues will impact revenue, but I fear this might just be the tip of the iceberg.

I also fear headwinds from privacy changes by Apple or even competition from Google.

For me personally, I think Ill buy a small position at first because this way, I have less risk. However, with AppLovin's potential growth rate, the position could still develop into a significant part of my portfolio.

2024-08-14,1723617465.0,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now youre probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now youre probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing. 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you dont personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didnt decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor but Apple isnt cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Ok lets keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you dont use their products you personally know someone who uses them. Theyre everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and its expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels havent been seen since 2018.

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but Nike isnt cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why its down. Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowes

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home youre familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing youre paying attention to these two companies as theyre crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowes. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowes stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowes down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe youre not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and its only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease its only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and theyre causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally dont think so. However I think going forward we wont see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts.

2024-08-14,1723637688.0,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",stocks,49.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.96808260679245

Electric scooters, wearables, smartphones, electric cars, vacuum cleaners, televisions, kitchen appliances, monitors, hairdryers, speakers, air purifiers, etc. Consequently, a huge user base that uses their apps and products. Therefore, there's a lot of room to tune and integrate everything well.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF todays stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramers high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors headlong rush into the American chipmakers shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidias artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the worlds most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that titleand $900bn in valueamid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang? Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidias boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S",stocks,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2momw/what_could_stop_the_nvdia_frenzy/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9968910813331604

2024-08-28,1724868388.0,Foot Locker shares drop 12% despite first comparable sales growth in six quarters ,"Foot Locker on Wednesday said comparable sales grew for the first time in six quarters as its efforts to refresh its stores and improve the customer experience continue to bear fruit. 

The beleaguered sneaker companys same-store sales grew 2.6% during its fiscal second quarter, far better than the 0.7% uptick that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Its gross margin also expanded for the first time in more than two years. 

Despite the positive trends, the companys shares dropped about 12% in early trading.

The Lace Up Plan is working, CEO Mary Dillon said in a press release, referencing the companys turnaround strategy. Our top line trends strengthened as we moved through the quarter, including a solid start to Back-to-School. We were also particularly pleased to deliver stabilization in our Champs Sports banner. 

Heres how Foot Locker did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Loss per share: 5 cents adjusted vs. 7 cents expected 

Revenue: $1.90 billion vs. $1.89 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 3, Foot Locker had a loss of $12 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a loss of $5 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Foot Locker posted a loss of 5 cents per share. 

Sales rose to $1.90 billion, up about 2% from $1.86 billion a year earlier. 

For the current fiscal year, Foot Locker largely maintained its guidance and continues to expect sales to be in a range of a 1% decline to 1% growth from the prior year  better than the 0.4% decline that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Foot Locker also stood by its adjusted earnings per share guidance. It expects earnings to be between $1.50 and $1.70  much of that range ahead of the $1.54 that analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Since former Ulta Beauty boss Mary Dillon took the helm of Foot Locker about two years ago, she has worked to transform the company and ensure that it stays relevant in a world where brands arent as reliant on multibrand retailers as they were in the past. 

Dillon has worked to repair the companys relationship with its biggest brand partner, Nike, and has also taken a hard look at its sprawling, but aging, store fleet, where the company does about 80% of its sales. The company plans to spend $275 million upgrading its stores this year, and it expects to have two-thirds of its fleet remodeled by the end of fiscal 2025.

In an interview with CNBC, Dillon said the store investments are leading to increased conversion, basket size and profitability, and better performance for Foot Lockers womens business.

The reason that were doing it is that it is working for us, both in terms of enhancing a customer experience and a striper [store employee] experience, but also the financial returns, said Dillon. The performance is ahead of what we thought.

In a series of new megastores Foot Locker is building in hotspots like New York City and Paris, the retailer is working hand in hand with Nike to develop some portions of the shops.

With Nike, this has been since Day One, a high priority for me, and really building a partnership that isnt just about like, what number of shoes are we going to sell, but how do we think about using consumer insights to mutually grow our businesses together, said Dillon. For us and Nike, its about the places that we really connect.

Dillon has also worked to streamline costs at Foot Locker. On Wednesday, the company said it was closing its stores and e-commerce operations in South Korea, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and will rely on a third party for operations in Greece and Romania, where it plans to expand its reach, according to Dillon. In all, 30 of Foot Lockers 140 stores in the Asia-Pacific region and 629 in Europe will be closed or go under a new operator as part of the changes. 

Foot Lockers Champs banner, which has been dragging down the companys overall performance, is also showing some signs of improvement. During the quarter, comparable sales were down 3.9%, which is an improvement from the 25.3% decline it saw in the year-ago period.

Foot Locker is also planning to move its global headquarters from New York City to St. Petersburg, Florida, in late 2025 and plans to maintain only a limited presence in the Big Apple moving forward. 

The intent of the relocation is to further build on the Companys meaningful presence in St. Petersburg and to enable increased collaboration among teams across banners and functions, while also reducing costs, Foot Locker said in a news release. 

Dillon told CNBC the move will increase margins by 0.2 percentage point by 2027, but the decision wasnt just based on saving money.

Weve got a big center of gravity already in St. Pete ... many of our executives are there. A lot of our commercial teams, said Dillon. We think actually bringing more people together for collaboration is going to matter and thats also part of this. Its not just about saving money. Its about, how do we really continue to build on this momentum?

The company isnt planning to make employees relocate and Dillon, who is based in Chicago, wont be forced to become a super commuter, either.

I am traveling, I would say, 90% of the time, to our teams around the world, and to our brand partners, and to investor meetings and to events, said Dillon. I spend a good chunk of time in New York, I spend a lot of time in St. Pete, I spend a lot of time in Amsterdam where we have our headquarters, and visiting our brand partners. So Im planning to keep my primary residence in Chicago, but the way that this has been working is really, I think, working pretty well so were going to continue to do that.

As it improves stores, products, and the customer experience online and in stores, Foot Locker is managing to drive sales even as its core consumer continues to feel the pressure of consistent inflation and high interest rates  indicating that Dillons efforts are working. 

Were not expecting our customer to get, like, less pressured or more pressured. Were just trying to say this is a category they care about, said Dillon. How can Foot Locker be the best to serve their needs? And I think our results are showing that thats working.

As of Tuesdays close, shares of the company are up more than 5% this year, compared with Nikes stock, which has fallen more than 21% in the same time period.

Demand has undoubtedly slowed across the retail industry, but consumers are still spending. Theyre just being far choosier on who theyre spending with  which has made execution that much more important. 

Our strategies are building momentum as we look to the remainder of the year, said Dillon in a statement. I remain confident that we are taking the right actions to position the Company for its next 50 years of profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.

2024-08-29,1724936385.0,Best Buy shares jump on profit beat and guidance hike ,"Best Buy raised its fiscal-year profit guidance Thursday after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations for the most recent quarter.

The retailer now expects to see full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.10 to $6.35, up from a prior range of $5.75 to $6.20. The company, however, lowered the top end of its guidance ranges for both full-year revenue and comparable sales.

As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our industry to continue to show increasing stabilization, Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas said in the companys press release.

Shares of Best Buy jumped more than 14% in premarket trading Thursday.

Heres how the consumer electronics retailer did for the period ended August 3 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.34 vs. $1.16 expected

Revenue: $9.29 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

The company reported net income for the quarter of $291 million, or $1.34 per share, compared with $274 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. 

Net sales in the quarter dropped to $9.29 billion from $9.58 billion during the same period a year earlier.

Comparable sales declined 2.3% during the quarter, compared with a 6.2% decline a year earlier.

Best Buy has been in the midst of an attempted turnaround in response to a two-year sales slump. Discretionary merchandise retailers across the board have struggled with softer consumer demand in the wake of unusually high sales throughout the Covid pandemic and as consumers pullback due to high inflation.

As the much-awaited replacement cycle of pandemic-era tech purchases starts trickling in, the retailer is hoping to cash in through marketing and operational initiatives. Best Buy said in July that it would add trained sales teams to three key parts of its stores  computing, appliance, and home theater  and kick off a marketing campaign that includes YouTube videos to draw consumer interest.

The company was also betting on a wave of new tech gadget debuts, such as a collection of new iPads launched by Apple in May and artificial intelligence-enabled laptops touted by Microsoft, to drive sales.

The company on Thursday posted comparable sales growth of 6% in the domestic tablet and computing categories. However, that was more than offset by declines in appliances, home theater and gaming, executives said.

We capitalized on demand driven by our customers desire to replace or upgrade their products, combined with new innovation, CEO Corie Barry said during the companys earnings call. We see a consumer who is seeking value in sales events and one who is also willing to spend on high-price-point products when they need to or when there is new, compelling technology.

Barry said AI could continue to boost sales across categories over the next few years.

We believe we are just at the beginning of the impact of AI on tech innovation and customer demand, she said.

If the rally holds, it will be the third-biggest rally for the stock since the companys IPO in January 2021. The stock was trading at $42.17 as of early afternoon.

Following the market close on Wednesday, Affirm said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter climbed 48% from a year earlier to $659 million, and that its net loss narrowed to $45.1 million from $206 million in the same period a year ago. The company beat estimates for revenue and reported a narrower-than-expected loss.

For the current quarter, Affirm sees revenue in the range of $640 million and $670 million. Analysts polled by LSEG called for revenue of $625 million.

Affirm CEO Max Levchin said in a note to shareholders that the company set a new goal of hitting operating profitability on a GAAP basis by the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025.

Analysts for Mizuho called it a killer quarter for Affirm in a note on Thursday, and said the prospect of turning GAAP operating income-positive will be a major milestone.

Even after Thursdays rally, Affirm shares are still down about 14% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%. But the stock has been trending higher lately, up 50% in August. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday that lower interest rates could be coming as soon as September.

Bank of America analysts said in a note last month that rate cuts would be beneficial to Affirms funding costs and for gain on loan sales. The company moved its merchants to a 36% APR cap on loans, up from 30% previously, and analysts said this should remain a tailwind for yields and GMV growth.

Mizuho projects that a new Apple Pay partnership could add $12 billion to Affirms total addressable market once it goes live later this year.

2024-09-04,1725454841.0,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-06,1725583252.0,Broadcom says it will sell $12 billion in AI parts and custom chips this year,"Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.

Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.

Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:

Earnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected

Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected

Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.

Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.

The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.

Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Googles TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.

2024-09-09,1725925621.0,Goldman Sachs to post $400 million hit to third quarter on consumer unwind ,"Goldman Sachs will post a roughly $400 million pretax hit to third-quarter results as the bank continues to unwind its ill-fated consumer business.

CEO David Solomon said Monday at a conference that by unloading Goldmans GM Card business, as well as a separate portfolio of loans, the bank would post a hit to revenues when it reports results next month.

It is the latest turbulence related to Solomons push into consumer retail. In late 2022, Goldman began to pivot away from its nascent consumer operations, beginning a series of write-downs related to selling chunks of the business. Goldmans credit card business, in particular its Apple Card, allowed rapid growth in retail lending, but also led to losses and friction with regulators.

Goldman is instead focusing on asset and wealth management to help drive growth. The bank was in talks to sell the GM Card platform to Barclays, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.

Solomon also said Monday that trading revenue for the quarter was headed for a 10% decline because of a tough year-over-year comparison and difficult trading conditions in August for fixed-income markets.

2024-04-30,1714484680.0,"PayPal lifts 2024 profit forecast as spending stays resilient, margins improve ","PayPal raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast on Tuesday, as the payments giant benefited from robust consumer spending, while measures to cut costs improved operating margins in the first quarter.

Shares of the company were last up 4% in volatile premarket trading after the results.

Consumer spending has shown remarkable resilience even as economic worries clouded the outlook for the payments sector for months. Though lower-income brackets have curbed discretionary purchases, most Americans are still looking to shop online, dine-out and travel.

PayPals newly appointed management is also aiming to reignite investor confidence through efforts to make the company leaner and lower costs to ease pressure on its stock, which was among the worst performers on the Nasdaq last year.

Earlier this year, PayPal had announced plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its global workforce.

2024 remains a transition year and we are focused on execution  driving our key strategic initiatives, realizing cost-savings and reinvesting appropriately, said CEO Alex Chriss.

The company expects 2024 adjusted profit to increase by mid-to-high single-digit percentage, compared with its earlier forecast of it remaining flat.

PayPal also expects second-quarter revenue to grow 7% on FX-neutral basis, largely in line with Wall Street expectations.

Total payment volumes increased 14% to $403.9 billion in the first quarter, while net revenue climbed 10% to $7.7 billion on a currency-neutral basis.

PayPals operating margins improved 84 basis points, on an adjusted basis, to 18.2% in the first quarter. Its margins have been central to investor anxieties over the last year as growth slowed post-pandemic.

The companys low-margin business products have risen strongly, while growth in its branded products slowed due to increased pressure from competitors such as Apple.

Its adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.08 in the three months ended March 31, compared with 85 cents a year ago.

2024-02-07,1707342208.0,"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales","Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Heres how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and its more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arms license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

2024-02-14,1707912335.0,Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue,"Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.

The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.

The cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.

Sony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.

The companys challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.

Rival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.

Sales at Sonys gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.

Sony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.

Sony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.

Heres how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected

Operating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected

Sony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.

Sonys financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.

Sony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.

Meanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.

Hiroki Totoki, Sonys chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has great growth potential, adding that the company will seek various opportunities in the country and will look into plans to replace the failed merger with Zee.

2024-02-15,1707956054.0,"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. Its the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmakers stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Googles $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques  such as transformer architecture  used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a code red situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

2024-02-16,1708107516.0,Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),"First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  
  
It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  
No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  
  
First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  
  
You could say its because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  
It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  
  
AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  
  
How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  
Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But its not just any Product. Its a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  
An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  
  
This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  
  
This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  
  
They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  
  
How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  
  
Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  
  
\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  
  
\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  
  
\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  
  
\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  
  
The Analogy:  
  
Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  
  
TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  
  
The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  
  
At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  
  
Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  
  
Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  
  
What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  
  
Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.  
  
\----  
  
NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  
  
Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and thats their moat. This tells me that the person doesnt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  
  
NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They only design them.  
  
Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? Its TSMC.  
TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  
  
So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big Chip Design Company. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult moat part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  
  
There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  
  
So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  
Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  
This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  
  
Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  
  
AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  
  
Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime theyre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  
  
According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  
  
Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  
  
Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  
  
However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apples GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidias GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  
  
Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apples commitment to developing its own graphics technology. (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)  
  
Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:

*Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.*  
  
*To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.*  
  
*The final list of named trends we researched was:*  
  
*-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.*  
  
*-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.*  
  
*-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.*  
  
*-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.*

*-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.*  
  
*-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce*

*Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.*  
  
*For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade.

2024-03-04,1709581223.0,Speculative Crap I'm Investing In So You Don't Have to,"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now

**1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.

**2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.

**3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.

**4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.

**5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.

2024-03-04,1709587230.0,Has Spotify run up too much? They have a margin problem,"Spotify stock has gone on a huge tear lately, almost quadrupling its stock price from a recent low around USD 70-75 to currently over 271. Im sure this has to do with several consecutive earnings reports in which they demonstrated that they could:

1. Increase the number of subscribers and even re-accelerate growth despite their huge size
2. Squeeze more money from subscribers and increase ARPU, despite growing quickly outside of Europe and the USA where revenue per user tends to be lower. 


While this is positive news and doubling premium subscribers since 2020 (while facing heavy competition) is impressive, Im struggling to see how they will ever turn this revenue into profit. 

The problem is twofold:


1. Spotify is totally beholden to major music labels which operate in an oligopolistic market. Spotify pays royalties to labels whenever a song is played, and they cannot at all afford to lose any of the labels. No one would use a music streaming service that is missing the entire catalogue of all major artists signed to one of the labels. So as Spotify gets more users, not only do they automatically have to pay more money for more plays, the labels can renegotiate and demand more money. This problem becomes apparent in their gross margins (more on that later). 


2. Spotify is the only major pure play music streaming service. Their competition is Apple Music, Google/Youtube Premium, Amazon Prime. Excluding China, these make up well over 90% of the global market, but all their competitors have far more ability to bundle their services/subscriptions and run the music streaming at loss/breakeven by increasing royalty payments. Now, Spotify holds about 30% of the global market share compared to Apple Music at 13.7%, Amazon at 13.3% and Google at 9% (according to MIDIA Research). So they are the market leader by far which has its benefits. But switching streaming providers, while not totally painless, is easy enough that I believe they would lose a lot of subscribers if they raise prices too high. 


A few numbers that seem to underline my thoughts:


In 2023 they raised premium prices for the first time ever(!) in the USA, to 10.99. This is the same exact price as Apple and YouTube Music (without YouTube Premium). While a good deal for customers, it shows they have no pricing power. 


Their gross margin in the last quarter was 25.6%. Not only is this in fact lower than their gross margin right after their IPO 6 years ago (25.7%), it is a margin that doesnt seem to support their valuation of 3.6 currently. 


Premium subscriptions are their main source of revenue at 86% of total revenue. This number has not changed in over 2 years. Ad supported revenue not only has a terrible 11.6% gross margin but is not growing in a meaningful way. 


Their other initiatives like podcasting and some hardware experiments have mostly failed. In fact they decided to release the Joe Rogan podcast on other services despite sinking several hundred millions into it. they are now trying to push audiobooks and merch sales as new profit drivers. Those are nice to have but I doubt theyll make a meaningful difference. It seems to me if you are enough of a fan of an artist to buy their merch, you will just do it on their Website. 


Their one positive seems to be increasing free cash flow, which has roughly doubled in the past three years. They seem to be succeeding at generating some operating leverage. However with a 26% gross margin their biggest cost driver by far remains royalty payments. 


I guess the stock has some appeal as the market leader and main pure play publicly listed music streaming company, but to me it seems like a short candidate.

2024-03-07,1709848865.0,TikTok crackdown bill unanimously approved by US House panel,"The U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee on Thursday unanimously approved legislation giving China's ByteDance six months to divest from short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban.

The 50-0 vote represents the most significant momentum for a U.S. crackdown on TikTok, which has about 170 million U.S. users, which had stalled over the last year amid heavy lobbying by the company.

Lawmakers hope to move quickly on the measure and said the U.S. House of Representatives could take up the bill in the coming weeks.

""This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States,"" the company said after the vote. ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.""
Before the vote, lawmakers got a closed-door classified briefing on national security concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.

....

The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok; if it did not, app stores operated by Apple, Google, and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

2024-03-08,1709863974.0,Costco misses holiday-quarter revenue expectations despite online growth,"Costco on Thursday missed Wall Streets revenue expectations for its holiday quarter, despite reporting year-over-year sales growth and strong e-commerce gains.

Shares of the retailer fell about 4% in aftermarket trading. The retailers stock had hit a 52-week high earlier in the day.

Heres what the retailer reported for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $3.92 vs. $3.62 expected

Revenue: $58.44 billion vs. $59.16 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Feb. 18, Costcos net income rose to $1.74 billion, or $3.92 per share, compared to $1.47 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier.

Costcos revenue for the quarter increased from $55.27 billion in the year-ago period.

Comparable sales for the company increased 5.6% year over year and 4.3% in the U.S. Excluding changes in gas prices and foreign currency, the metric increased 5.8% overall and 4.8% in the U.S.

Sales of food and sundries, a category that includes snack foods and beverages, were up by mid single-digits in the quarter, CFO Richard Galanti said on the companys earnings call. Fresh foods were up high single-digits and non-foods were up mid single-digits.

Ancillary businesses, which includes more service-related purchases like travel, were up by low single-digits, he said. Costcos food court, pharmacy and optical centers were top performers in the quarter and gas was down low single-digits as the price per gallon fell.

More shoppers came to Costco, and they spent more on their shopping trips during the quarter. Traffic increased 5.3% across the globe and 4.3% in the U.S., Galanti said on the earnings call. Average ticket increased in the U.S. and worldwide, he said.

Inflation was roughly flat year over year in the quarter, which allowed the retailer to reduce prices for some items, Galanti said. For example, he said, its been able to cut the price of reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99 and slash the price of a 48-count of Kirkland Signature batteries from $17.99 to $15.99. In the prior quarter, he said inflation was as much as 1% year over year.

Galanti said many new items in categories like sporting goods and lawn and garden will also have lower prices compared with a year ago because of falling freight and commodity costs.

Costco has 875 warehouses, including 603 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also has clubs in about a dozen other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and China.

In the second quarter, Costco opened four new clubs, including three in the U.S. and one in Shenzhen, China. That marked its sixth club to open in China, Galanti said. Two of the three new U.S. locations were Costco Business Centers, which are specifically geared toward small business owners like restaurant operators.

As of Thursdays close, Costco shares have risen nearly 19% since the start of the year. The stock touched a 52-week high of $787.08 earlier in the day and closed at $785.59, bringing the companys market value to nearly $350 billion.

Digital growth

Costco has made changes to its website to improve the experience for online shoppers, Galanti said Thursday. Its also tweaked its business to be more digitally savvy.

E-commerce sales grew 18.4% in the quarter compared with the year earlier.

For example, Costco rolled out a new mobile app homepage in February, which loads in less than two seconds compared with eight seconds previously  a move he said was crucial since about 60% of its e-commerce business is done through its mobile app and mobile browser.

It rolled out Apple Pay last week to all members online. And its adding more merchandise to Costco Next, a seller platform that allows members to buy directly from some of the retailers suppliers at a discounted price. The marketplace carries a wide variety of items, including electronics, bicycles and apparel, he said.

E-commerce sales have also gained momentum as Costco has gotten better in recent months at touting the value of its online merchandise, particularly for big-ticket items like appliances, mattresses and tires, he said.

App downloads were up 2.8 million in the quarter and and currently total about 33 million, Galanti said.

Membership fees

Costco has seen more membership sign-ups as the company has cracked down on membership sharing, Galanti said. During the pandemic, he said the warehouse club noticed more people using their mom or dads membership card and let it slide. Then, he said, the membership sharing grew because self-checkout became more common at clubs.

Now, he said, Costco is requiring more checking of membership cards to make sure it matches the shopper.

Are we getting some new you signups from it? Absolutely, he said. Relative to the 60 or 70 million members its not terribly meaningful, but its more fair and the right thing to do.

Yet he said member sharing at Costco wasnt as large of a problem as Netflix, another company that cracked down. Compared with Netflix, he said, it was harder for Costco members to share because they still needed to have a persons physical card when they walked in.

Investors have been waiting for Costco to raise its membership fees for more than a year. The company has typically increased its annual fee roughly every five and a half years. It last hiked fees in June 2017.

But Galanti said the company is not hiking the fee yet. Though he added, Its when, not if.

The longtime CFO, who is retiring, has hosted all but one earnings call since Costco went public in 1985. He joked on Thursdays call that the fee hike will be a task for his successor, Gary Millerchip, the former CFO of Kroger, after he takes over in mid-March.

Ive been joking with Gary, it will be on his watch, not mine, Galanti said.

The Association is currently negotiating a billion-dollar deal with ESPN and Warner Bros.

The NBA hopes to double its combined rights payout to $50 billion or more for its next long-term cycle of media rights.*

*Of course, Disney chairman Bob Iger, who got the ball rolling by telling CNBC this summer that he was willing to sell ESPN and the Mouse Houses other linear TV properties, could decide to keep his favorite sports network after testing the winds.*

In a previous SEC filing, Disney revealed that Bristol delivered $2.9 billion in profits from $16 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022.

If you had to choose between picking one of these companies right now, which one would you go for?

AMD is obviously quite expensive, over inflated right now and a lot is banking on their AI chips to kick off and get in the market. So far they have been steady grabbing market share for PCs and servers but Qualcomm is expected to come in a new competitor.

Apple has already proved the value of ARM based CPUs and if Qualcomm can do the same for Windows laptops then that's gonna spell trouble for amd and Intel.

2024-03-17,1710691335.0,The best DD on Canada Goose $GOOS,"Canada Goose (GOOS) grew its revenue and stock price like crazy until 2018. Then CEO Dani Reiss changed strategy to focus on direct to consumer and non-winter luxury fashion products. It worked well for their competitor Moncler and the ideas were popular generally. Also, why not cash in on the brand's popularity year-round instead of just selling winter coats? 

Meanwhile, lower priced brands like Moose Knuckles and Arc'teryx were on the rise. So it was easier for GOOS to move upward to luxury and compete more directly with Moncler. But the company still sells it's durable and functional parkas to governments, businesses, and the public. So the risky move upward is countered by a solid recurring (albeit seasonal) business.

Just to be clear, the company took on three simultaneous transformations. First, it switched from primarily wholesale to primarily DTC. Second, it switched from primarily functional heavy weight down to a broad product offering that can be worn year round (like shoes, T-shirts, etc). Third, it switched from durable and functional to artistic products made in limited quantities in collaboration with various artists and fashion designers. That's a lot for any company to take on simultaneously. And it came with its costs for Canada Goose.

Customers and investors didn't like the initial results of those changes. Customers complained about product quality (less goose down fill was seen as low quality) and price increases. The lightweight jackets and apparel contrasted with the heavy duty parkas in a way that made them seem lower quality. The fashion aspect wasn't creating enough appeal to offset those changes for functionality-minded customers either. 

Investors saw revenue growth slow, and operational costs and inventory soar. Wholesale revenue shrunk as the company discontinued existing relationships to focus on direct to consumer. They only kept the wholesalers who made the Canada Goose brand more valuable. This immediately started to impact revenue growth and still does. Luckily last earnings call management said they will grow wholesale alongside DTC from here if it is brand accretive. This self inflicted recession by Canada Goose was bigger than any actual recreation would impact them.

That combined with the push to luxury fashion, increased marketing, leasing, and construction costs. Inventory went up partially because of failed fashion experiments, but mostly because of warm winters and work from home. So slower sales growth, tighter margins, and higher inventory made investors lose interest, but they were intentional sacrifices to benefit the brand long term.

Direct to consumer doesn't work certain products (like mattresses - remember Casper?) but it does for Moncler and Apple. No one sees what brand mattress you sleep on, but they do see what coat or fashion you wear. So brands are stronger in fashion apparel, especially outdoor fashion apparel. Both Moncler and Apple retail locations showcase their products like jewelry showrooms. 

So that's the direct to consumer vision GOOS adopted for their retail stores. It takes a lot of upfront investment to build such stores, and a lot of temporary operational expenses experimenting with marketing and products.

2024-03-18,1710793879.0,Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year,"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidias developers conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.

Nvidias share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAIs ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidias high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.

The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.

Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the companys developer conference in San Jose, California. Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.

The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.

Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.

The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways, said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. Of course, we still do that. But whats really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.

Das said Nvidias new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidias GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.

If youre a developer, youve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, well make sure that its runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people, Das said.

Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the companys Hopper architecture  used by chips such as the H100  which was announced in 2022.

Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.

The chip includes what Nvidia calls a transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.

The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.

Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. Thats much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.

Nvidia didnt provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems its used in. Nvidias Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.

Nvidia also announced its adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.

NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.

The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.

Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.

In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead, Das said.

Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

2024-03-01,1709275569.0,(Time Magazine) Reddit files to list IPO: Why Reddit Users Have Turned Against the Companys IPO,"*Two years ago, Reddit users established themselves as a fearsome economic force when the subreddit community WallStreetBets mobilized to save GameStops stock price from pessimistic Wall Street traders. Now, Reddit itself is hoping to tap into its users unruly energy by allowing them to participate in the companys IPO. Reddit filed to go public last Thursday, seeking a valuation of at least $5 billion. Crucially, the company said it would set aside a large number of shares for 75,000 of the companys most prolific users, who might be able to profit off the companys financial success and have a seat at the company table. Now you can become one of our (non-corporate) overlords, Reddit wrote in a public statement.*

*But rather than galvanizing the community, the news was met with fierce backlash and pessimism from many Redditors. Users on various subreddits responded by casting doubt on the companys business model, complaining about recent changes to the site, and ironically threatening to wield their collective power to bet against the companys stock. The overwhelming negativity from Reddits own community highlights the risk of the companys decision to go public and the challenges of social media companies keeping both their investors and users happy at the same time.*

***User Backlash***

*Reddit is one of the most-visited wTebsites in the U.S., with 73.1 million daily active users. But the company is still unprofitable: While it grew 21% in revenue last year, it also lost more than $90 millionalthough that was an improvement on the $158 million it lost the year before. Compared to Instagram, X and other social media platforms, Reddit has especially struggled to monetize its audience through ads, partially because its content is generally more freewheeling and untamed than its counterparts.*

*The company has many high-profile backers, including Tencent Holdings, Fidelity, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who was once briefly Reddits CEO. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will serve as the offerings lead underwriters. But very few companies have even decided to go public in the last few years, due to a turbulent stock market and high interest rates. Reddit will be the first major tech initial public offering of 2024, and the first social media IPO since Pinterest in 2019.*

*Reddit is powered by users who post content and moderate the site for free. (Last fall, Reddit announced that users who created viral posts would be able to earn money.) And while Redditors tend to be intensely devoted to their subreddits, many have grown increasingly disillusioned with the platform overall. Last summer, hundreds of Reddit communities engaged in a widespread blackout to protest price changes for third-party app developers.*

*Now, many Redditors see the IPO as another example of how the company is prioritizing its bottom line at the expense of its users. If anything I think it devalues Reddit because now the board has to do things for investors instead of doing things for the Reddit community, wrote one user.*

*Ed Zitron, the CEO of EZPR who also publishes analysis on tech and social media via a podcast and a newsletter, argues that Reddits lack of focus on monetization is exactly what makes it so special as a platform. Reddit is one of the last bastions of user-generated content on the internet thats actually reliable and well-policed, he says. But the current way Reddit works is antithetical to good advertising.*

*In order to try to make the community feel included in the IPO, Reddit has established a Directed Shares Program, which lets the most active Redditors buy shares at the same discounted price as major investors. But many Redditors responded to that idea with disdain as well. They're trying to trick us into buying their stock to pump the price, wrote one user. Another compared the program to a company throwing a pizza party for its workers, but then forcing its workers to buy the pizza.*

*One Redditor, Matthew Benedict, wrote in a message to TIME that they were invited by Reddit to participate in the IPO, but have no plans to buy any shares. Benedict is a moderator for* r/LegacyJailbreak, *a community with 45,000 members that offers tips about circumventing software restrictions on Apple devices. The user said that recent changes to Reddit have made it harder for moderators to lead their community*. *I'm not optimistic and find it very ironic that they want to invite moderators to participate in the IPO after making changes that have prevented my fellow moderators from moderating*, *they wrote*.

*A spokesperson for Reddit did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.*

***Training Artificial Intelligence***

*As is the case with many business decisions this year, artificial intelligence is playing a role in Reddits decision to go public. Reddit just announced a licensing deal for Google to use Reddit data to train and build its A.I. systems. Steve Huffman, Reddits CEO, said in a public letter that the platforms data advantage in training AI models will allow the company to earn revenue. Reddit expects to make more $203 million over the next three years from data licensing agreements, according to the IPO filing.*

*But on Reddit, users voiced concern that AI advances could only increase the proliferation of chatbots on the site. One user speculated that Reddit could be particularly susceptible to an increase in bots compared with other social media platforms, because most of its users are anonymous, reducing the sites appeal.*

*Zitron says that Reddits issues with bots arent unique, but potentially damaging all the same. Like any other social media platform, there are forces at play who are going to spam it with nonsense and manipulate Reddit to their advantage, Zitron says. If its AI thats upvoting and downvoting posts, that will destroy the fabric of what makes Reddit useful.*

*Nick Smith, a senior research analyst at the IPO-focused Renaissance Capital, says that Reddits data partnerships will help contribute to the companys growth and profitability. But its down an uncertain path, he says. Reddit is highly unprofitable: Over the last 3 years, it hemorrhaged more than $300 million in free cash flow. Thats one of the big issues, because investors are focused on profitability, and being more discerning in that aspect.*

***The Wall Street Bets factor***

*Looming over Reddits IPO is the subreddit* r/WallStreetBets, *which is one of the platforms biggest and most powerful communities. In 2021, its users banded together to invest in meme stocks like GameStop and AMC, wreaking havoc on Wall Street trading firms that had bet against them. Their actions forced major investors to rethink the very premise of what made a stock valuable*.

*If* r/WallStreetBets *gets involved in the Reddit IPO, the community holds the collective power to move the companys stock price in unpredictable ways. While professional investors participating in IPOs typically hold shares for a long time, individual investors often sell shares more actively, leading to price swings. Reddit acknowledged this in its IPO filing, writing in its Risk Factors section that the participation of Redditors could result in increased volatility.*

*In 2021, Robinhood, a stock trading app that itself was lifted up by* r/WallStreetBets, *went public and similarly allowed its ravenous users access to the IPO. But Robinhoods stock price dropped significantly after going public and has failed to come close to its IPO price*.

*The Robinhood IPO saga did not go unnoticed by WallStreetBetsand many people on that subreddit responded scathingly to Reddits own IPO announcement. Users especially took umbrage with Huffmans more than $193 million compensation in 2023 (including stock and option awards), while volunteer moderators who do the heavy lifting of organizing and overseeing the sites communities make nothing. Many users actually threatened to short Reddits stock: to bet on its failure. They're selling user generated content to AI companies without offering user compensation, wrote one user, adding: Short these pricks.*

*Smith believes it will be difficult and expensive for retail investors to actually short selleffectively bet againstReddits IPO in its initial trading days. But he says that institutional investors are monitoring the negative sentiment around the announcement and how it might impact Reddits profitability. If the user anger translates into either slow or negative user growth, that will be a problem for institutional investors, he says.*

*However, there are some users who still believe in the sites viability and the potential of the IPO to be successful. One user, who said his name was Kevon but asked to remain anonymous over concerns about his job and personal life, wrote to TIME in a direct message that he planned to buy shares in the IPO, believing that the current negative sentiment was more of a product of Reddits tendency to devolve into hivemind than any actual expertise or insight. Every year there are comments that the site/company are going downhill from what it used to be, he wrote. Yet it continues to grow at a rapid pace.*

The worlds largest contract chipmaker is running well ahead of estimates for revenue growth in the current quarter, after sales increased by 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors. The global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market, which may drive orders for TSMCs traditional mainstay of mobile chips.

US-traded shares were up 3% in New York in early trading on Friday.

Hsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.s highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable.

When the joint venture was announced, some had jokingly dubbed it Spulu, a mash-up of sports and Hulu, which had originally been formed as a JV among TV broadcasters.

The venture also launched a new website at venu.com. A notice at the bottom of the landing page says, Launch is conditional on receiving regulatory approval and is expected for Fall 2024. The sites terms of service indicate that its operated by Rookie Enterprises, LLC, a subsidiary of Fox Corp. In announcing the new name, the three companies also noted that the JV is still pending the finalization of definitive agreements amongst the parties.

The Justice Department reportedly has planned to review the three-way venture to look at anticompetitive implications, and last month two leading congressional Democrats expressed concerns that the JV may result in higher prices for consumers and less fair licensing terms for upstream sports leagues and downstream video distributors. Meanwhile, streaming TV provider Fubo filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the JV services launch, alleging the venture violates antitrust laws. On May 2, Fubo, DirecTV, Dish Network, Newsmax and others sent a letter to members of Congress calling for hearings on the state of competition in the pay-TV market, specifically calling out the Disney-Fox-WBD joint venture as rais[ing] serious competition concerns that call for Congresss immediate oversight.

Venu (pronounced venue) will be made available directly to consumers via a new app, the companies said. Subscribers will also have the ability to purchase it in a bundle, including with Disney+, Hulu or Max.

The JVs new name and brand identity were developed in partnership with R/GA, a global design and advertising firm. According to a spokesperson for the company, the Venu Sports name takes inspiration from where live sports lives: the stadiums, arenas, speedways, octagons, courts, rinks, ballparks and more, where fans come to watch and connect with the action.

2024-05-24,1716558605.0,Moving on from AAPL,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidias milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the companys pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industrys need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidias graphics processing units.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

2024-06-11,1718072943.0,Riding the MSFT Rocket ,"Riding the MSFT Rocket = 

Alright, heres 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volumes spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their buy rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it overweight, targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a buy. 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a buy, with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsofts advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsofts financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsofts robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**Theres been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsofts future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. Theyve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. Theyve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsofts investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azures growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsofts cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apples Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and its got people rethinking their game plan. Heres the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, Seriously, Apple? Thats it?
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldnt handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors werent having it. Apples stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say AI fail. Wall Streets questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didnt announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that theyre playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apples presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFTs solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: Im looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, its a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: Im targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: Im aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: Ill keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: Ill raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsofts push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains. Ill stay updated on financial and tech news to maximize the potential from this trade.

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

2024-08-01,1722487975.0,CNBC: Metas advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Metas massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the companys better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Metas core business.

The ways that its **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **theres a lot of upside there**, Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that were doing is going to improve that.

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Googles ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Metas advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the companys improved ad performance helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Metas refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**, said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBCs Closing Bell: Overtime on Wednesday. Its **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**, said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesdays earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI  popularized by OpenAIs ChatGPT  will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

Already seen a return Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

Youve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years, Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has really navigated some of the concerns and the storms from a couple years ago and is **clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.

Zino noted that Metas growth rates are **nicely outpacing those of its peers**.

**Meta isnt finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects **significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Metas AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with core AI helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that have translated into revenue gains.

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesnt expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in 24, but we do expect that theyre going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.",stocks,101.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh89pb/cnbc_metas_advertising_growth_is_proof_that_hefty/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9695092439651489

2023-09-17,1694955888.0,Wheel Strategy Idea: Super itm,"So, I've been doing some thinking/analysis about the wheel strategy. Some appeals to it are the guaranteed premiums it brings in, the relatively small risk it has, and the ability to be flexible in most markets (assuming you're wheeling a good stock). 

Usually, you try to sell your initial put otm for a chance at more later and to not get assigned at an ""upcharge."" Some people are able to make this their full time job. Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the ""salary"" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO). And to me, it seems even safer than buying and holding, due to the ""salary"" being instant.

I think it might be a bit much so I was thinking of dropping the small cap and VTI. 

Also what are thoughts on CCRV? Seems to good to be true but it looks attractive for the div payout. No major growth but 30% yield. There has to be a catch, and I'm just not realizing it. 


And what are thoughts on tossing some of the big holding in the large cap index's such as apple/XOM/msft/Amazon. I know the obvious, more risk but bigger upside and that's tempting but then i know there is a lot of apple in VGT/VOO for example. 


I would probally go 

25% VUG 

20% VOO

BBMC 5%

VGT 20%

VHT 10%

CCRV 10%

I think at worst the US will perform similarly to these countries, and at best will keep on being the driver of innovation/tech in the world due simply to its culture of innovation and hardcore capitalism (which has many, many cons).

The availability private debt products is rather restricted, with only a few ETFs accessible to the public, and Private Credit Funds reserved for high-net-worth individuals. On a theoretical level, debt instruments like loans and bonds seem more suitable for non-expert investors due to their typically lower volatility and seniority in the capital structure, ensuring repayment priority in case of bankruptcy.

  
Consider the scenario where a retail investor is prohibited from acquiring a portion of a private corporate loan issued to a highly liquid and information-disclosed entity like Apple. On the flip side, these same investors can readily engage in options trading through platforms like Robinhood. This regulatory incongruity raises questions about the rationale behind limiting access to seemingly lower-risk investments while allowing participation in more complex and risk-laden options trading.  


While I acknowledge the liquidity aspect, where bond investments typically involve a committed holding period compared to the more fluid nature of equity transactions, I wonder if there are additional facets to this regulatory framework that I might be overlooking.

2024-06-04,1717520532.0,Seeking basic BOND FUND strategy advice for a mid-retirement investor.,"I had a managed brokerage account for a few years when I was employed but when I retired in 2016 I decided I had the time to learn about investing and manage my own portfolio (I also have a 401k that is 65% of my total retirement egg but I can no longer contribute to it). I have come up to reasonable speed on stocks but I don't quite understand how bonds work. I do understand the (arguable, it seems) premise that bonds are generally less volatile than stocks and so are a balancing force in a portfolio. However, my question is: specifically -- 2 big chunks (30%) of my brokerage account are bond funds -- MTBIX and WMBIX. For the past 10 years at least these fund shares gone up and down by only a couple dollars (e.g. $8 to $10), as does their total gain/loss, however every month I get a non-taxable distribution from them which I've set up to reinvest. Is that basically how bonds work - you hold them and get regular (tax free) distributions from them? 

What I'm really trying to determine is should I keep these funds or sell them off to invest more in some basic ETFs instead. The rest of my brokerage portfolio is 60% in popular ETFs like VOO, SPYG, QQQ, SMH, and the rest in a handful of large-cap tech stocks -- AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, APPL. I should mention my 401k is quite broadly diversified across asset classes with 50% in equities the rest in fixed, guaranteed, bonds, REITs. 

I'm fairly comfortable I have enough cheddar in my combined brokerage and 401k accounts to fund my remaining retirement even through volatile market periods, but I'm just not clear if these 2 bond funds fit into my more risky brokerage account beyond just added stability and tax benefits, given my 401k is already fairly conservative and 65% of my overall investments.

Since I live at home with no monthly bills or responsibilities to cover, I'm wondering if my $500 emergency fund is too low, too high, or just right.

Now that my TFSA is maxed out and nearly my fhsa, I'm considering whether to start investing in individual blue-chip stocks like Apple and other companies I believe after my fhsa is maxed out , or if I should continue buying out XEQT in a non-registered account.

Additionally, if I buy more XEQT in my non-registered account, will I be able to transfer those holdings into my TFSA when I can contribute again, or will I need to sell them first to transfer? For reference, I use Questrade as my broker.

Thanks for your advice!

Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap. Projections from a June 12 UBS note suggested that, if Nvidia climbs to second and bumps Apple to third, it could result in the chipmakers weight in the fund vaulting to 21%, while Apple would be slimmed down to just 4.5%.

i've also heard that these are some of the recommended mutual funds to invest in: SWTSX, SWPPX, SWISX, FDGRX. which ones do you recommend for roth ira? 

i thought of maybe opening an account w/ fidelity for a roth ira so i can buy fractional shares of SPY and QQQ (since schwab doesn't let you buy fractional shares of ETFs), but if it's better to buy mutual funds instead, then i'll just stick with schwab.

But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight.

2024-07-12,1720752169.0,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy.

  
But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o.



So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

  
### Future

Im on the side of active only because I know what Im doing especially during high volatility when Im able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result.

Ive been hip to investing for a few years now, loading up $50 here and there in companies like Tesla, Nike, Apple& you know the big companies. 

But I had several realizations as Ive been continuously studying investing.

1. I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING! $50 here and there into the companies I named is BS. I learned just because a company is in the news often doesnt necessarily mean they have good financials (they turn a profit, steady growth, etc) 

2. NO STRUCTURE: $50 here and there is NO structure what so ever. I want to get to a place where I can invest $250 EVERY MONTH (Ill work my way up as my income increases) not just 3 or 7 months the year but 12 months. I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and Im serious about that expense just like I am my rent / car note. 

3. NO STRUCTURE (Continued): theres no portfolio management, I dont have a solid investment strategy.

So in a nut shell, Im investing all wrong. Im proud of my self for taking the steps to invest because majority of my blood line doesnt invest but I am one of the ones that isnt scared, I want to seek out the necessary information, and I want to apply it. 

So that being me to my questions.

"" how do I find a solid investment advisor/ CFA? 
"" what exactly do I look for? Im sure theres some bullshit advisors out there and I want to make SURE I dont run into one. My generational wealth depends on the quality of my advisor. Im just not sure how to do due diligence to even find the right person. This is way out of my arena. 

If anyone can offer advice, insight, recommendations, it would be much Appreciated.

This topic stresses me out so much because what if I really pick a sh!tty advisor and I dont reap the benefits I want in my retirement.

* Long term SP500 PE and CAPE are about 17.  $17 bought you $1 of corporate earnings.

* current SP500 PE is 27 (CAPE is 34).   Market is overpriced by 100% if you believe in CAPE.

* current QQQ PE is 36.5, even pricier.

* RSP (Invesco *Equal Weighted* SP500) has a fairly reasonable PE=21.   Essentially, it's no longer pulled up by huge contributions from NVDA, Apple, Alphabet, etc.   RSP hasn't grown much since the start of 2021.   

* yet in the dividend/value department, SCHD has PE=15.22 (if you believe Yahoo finance).  VYM has PE=16.5.   VYMY has PE=9.6.   These are all 'fairly' priced by historical standards.

I'm not sure I understand the low PE for SCHD and VYM on Yahoo finance, because a glance at the top-10 holdings of SCHD and VYM generally shows higher PE.  The top low PE components are oil majors.  But Schwab has a similar PE figure as Yahoo.    Maybe the low-PE stocks lurk in non-top holdings.

So, questions: 

If I were go back 20 or 30 or 50 years, would value stocks also have been be trading at PEs much lower than the market as a whole?   So whatever the equivalent of SCHD was would be trading at PE=10, say?    Or would value stocks have been trading at PE=16, and the dominance of a handful very high PE, high market cap stocks is a modern anomaly?

I'm from Germany, and we start something like an apprenticeship for 3 years at the age of 16. You work 40h a week though you alternate between work and a school meant to combine theory and practice and prepare you for an actual job in the field you did the apprenticeship in.

As I am gonna be working in the banking industry,I don't gave to pay any additional fees to a investment fund including a stock depot,if that's the right word. I am using the UniGlobal offer.

2024-07-10,1720655859.0,How far do you think we are in the AI stock market hype cycle?,"Early stages? Mid stages? Late stages?

Tech valuations are getting very rich, to their second-highest levels ever, even during the current 15+ year secular bull market (March 2009-present) marked by tech sector outperformance.

- Apple: $3.6 trillion, 36x earnings

- Microsoft: $3.5 trillion, 41x earnings

- NVIDIA: $3.3 trillion, 79x earnings

Right now, were still in a stage of the mania where simply saying AI is enough to make a stock rocket higher.

Apple will release its AI-enhanced iPhone 16 this autumn. If sales are weak, itll be clear that consumers arent as jazzed up about AI as markets are predicting. But the last few years havent had any notable upgrades at all, so there could still be an upgrade cycle.

While Affirm is currently in third place, the partnerships forged by the company with Shopify and Amazon are starting to pay off. In each of the past 5 quarters, Affirm has grown GMV (and revenue) significantly faster than its competitors, pulling away more strongly each quarter.

*GMV growth rate in Q1 2024:**

Affirm: 37%
Afterpay: 25%
Klarna: 18%


The e-commerce market in the USA is dominated by two competitors (yet another Oligopoly): Amazon and Shopify. Affirm has tie-ups with both of these, and is the default BNPL provider in the USA on the two websites. Partnerships like these are starting to drive incremental growth to Affirm  they dont have to spend a ton of money to acquire new customers, as anyone shopping on Shopify or Amazon will inevitably encounter them.

**Apple Pay partnerships confirms their dominance with large merchants*

They recently signed an agreement to become the default BNPL provider for Apple Pay. This is significant for three reasons:

1.      Incremental growth due to Apples size

Mizuho estimated that Apple Pay represents approximately USD 265 billion in US payment volumes, of which Affirm might capture USD 12 billion in GMV. At their current ratios, this would mean approximately USD 1 billion in incremental revenue for Affirm.

2.      Confirmation of Affirms track record

Even more importantly, it is yet another sign of a huge, customer-obsessed company signing with Affirm. These companies are placing a lot of trust in the fact that Affirm can provide a smooth customer experience, and it seems they have not let anyone down so far.

3.      Makes competition less likely

Affirm stock took a hit about a year ago when Apple first announced they would get into the BNPL business. Their fast withdrawal now signals not only that Affirm is a reliable provider for large companies, but also that the business has significant barriers to entry that even a huge company like Apple was not willing to attack.

Now that Affirm is offered at Amazon and Shopify, it is quite unlikely for these companies to adopt a second default BNPL option. In fact, Affirm had an exclusivity arrangement with Amazon that expired in January 2023, but the company has yet to add another BNPL provider. Why should they? As long as Affirm is able to fulfill all requests by customers who ask for BNPL, there is no need to complicate things with an additional provider.

**Conclusion**

Affirm is a bit of a controversial stock with varying price targets. Based on their financial track record and management, I am confident that they have set the right levers for continued growth in the coming years. On a 5-10 year timescale, I am very confident that Affirm will significantly outperform the overall e-commerce growth, as well as all its BNPL competitors.

2024-07-02,1719889532.0,"Paramount hunts for a streaming partner, could kick off a wave of deals ","Paramount Global is holding talks with other entertainment companies about merging its Paramount+ streaming service with an existing platform. If it reaches a deal, it may kick off a new wave of streaming partnerships that could put the entire media industry on firmer footing.

Paramount Global leadership is having active discussions with other media and tech company executives to determine if a structure makes sense for both parties where Paramount+ can be merged with another streaming entity and potentially co-owned, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

One of the companies that has expressed a desire to reach a deal is Warner Bros. Discovery, according to people familiar with the matter. Combining Max and Paramount+ could strengthen both services by allowing them to better compete with Netflix and Disneys suite of platforms (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for eyeballs and future content.

Warner Bros. Discovery held preliminary merger talks for a deal for all of Paramount Global earlier this year, but talks didnt escalate.

Paramount Global is also considering partnering with a technology platform, the companys co-CEO Chris McCarthy said at an employee town hall on June 25.

What they dont have is our scale of content, and together we will make for a very powerful combination to drive more minutes and greater profits, McCarthy said of a potential tech partner at the town hall, according to a transcript of the event obtained by CNBC.

A merged streaming service would mitigate churn by giving customers more diverse programming and fewer reasons to cancel each month, and it could take Paramount+ losses off Paramount Globals balance sheet by giving it new ownership.

While a structure for a hypothetical joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery hasnt been discussed in detail, ownership likely wouldnt be a 50-50 split given the existing natures of the streaming assets and their finances, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Warner Bros. Discoverys direct-to-consumer business made $103 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 after losing $2.1 billion the year before. Paramount Global reported a loss of $1.67 billion in direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization in 2023, narrower than its $1.8 billion loss a year prior.

Max has about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.

Comcasts NBCUniversal has also expressed interest in a joint venture with Paramount+, as The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this year. The talks didnt progress and never got particularly far, according to people familiar with the matter.

The sheer volume of hit content that we could offer together would be tremendous across TV, film and sports, and would attract millions of viewers, McCarthy said during the town hall in reference to a potential partnership with an existing subscription streaming service like Max or Peacock. Plus, we would share in all other non-content expenses.  

Spokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global declined to comment.

Streaming 2.0

Since late 2019, traditional media companies including Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery have all launched streaming services that have hemorrhaged billions of dollars in losses.

Theres long been consensus in the industry that there are too many streaming services relative to the number of total paying customers. Many executives have speculated that just four or five global services can likely survive and flourish. The others would need to be consolidated or folded into existing platforms.

There may be some combination of Paramount, Peacock and Max, said Peter Chernin, former CEO and chairman of Fox Group, in an interview with CNBC last year.

If Paramount reaches an agreement on a joint venture with either Max or Peacock, there would be added pressure on whichever service is left out to do a deal of its own.

Media companies are now focused on better monetizing streaming content through bundles and partnerships. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently become more willing to license some of their content to rival streaming services, such as Netflix, to better monetize shows that arent adding a lot of new subscribers to their streaming services.

Comcast recently introduced a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for its cable, broadband and mobile customers for $15 a month.

Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they plan to bundle their streaming services beginning in the summer. While the companies havent yet announced a price for the package, which will include Disney+, Hulu and Max, the discount will be significant, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.

Better windowing

Another hot topic of current discussions revolve around windowing movies and TV series through different streaming services at different price points.

This idea was something considered by Skydance Media, which nearly acquired Paramount Global before talks broke down last month.

Skydances plan for Paramount included merging Paramount+ with another streamer to create new streaming services which would better rationalize the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.

For example, Paramounts Showtime library could be combined with another companys prestige dramas to create a stand-alone ad-free service.

A different ad-supported service could then contain live sports and windowed prestige originals, which could appear on the second service after a certain amount of time. The services could be bundled together, such as how Disney bundles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

A representative for Skydance declined to comment.

One app experience

Theres a widespread shared sentiment among traditional media leadership that better packaging of existing content can be more lucrative for the entire industry.

The downside to more bundling or windowing of content is customer confusion. Increased mix-and-match offers between streaming services can easily lead to customer frustration rather than satisfaction.

Several media executives said privately they expect Peacock, Paramount+, Max and Disney could ultimately team up their programming within one application to alleviate confusion and compete with Netflix, which dominates the subscription streaming industry with about 270 million global subscribers.

Two executives said Disney would be the most likely company to own the application, given its relative dominant position in the entertainment streaming industry. Any media company who contributed content to the streaming application could share in the revenue, similar to how cable economics work today, they added.

Still, company rivalries and tensions may make such a product difficult to put together. While Max and Disney have struck a bundling deal, Comcast and Disney have long had a strained relationship. The two parties are currently trying to unwind a joint venture  Hulu  to give Disney full control over the service that was initially co-owned by NBCUniversal, Fox and Disney.

2024-07-08,1720476894.0,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.

Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.

2024-07-11,1720710673.0,"The 8 ""secrets"" of when to sell stocks. Do you have any other ideas?","1. **Everyone makes mistakes. Just be sure to cut all losses short.** Even the best investors get hit with a loss from time to time. But they don't indulge in worry as the stock drops even further. They [cut their losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and move on. Leave your ego and pride at the door. Don't let a loss get to you  either mentally or financially.
2. **If you don't sell too early, you'll sell too late.** To lock in solid gains, sell while your stock is still going up. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, ""Your objective is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."" Following the [20%-25% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) can help you do that. In a strong bull market, leading growth stocks like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Apple can, of course, run longer than expected. But locking in some profits along the way allows investors to safeguard a portion of those gains, while still maintaining a position to take advantage of a continued run. It also reduces the risk of giving back too much in an extended pullback.
3. **Have a sell plan in place** ***before*** **you buy.** The real drama kicks in when it comes time to sell. If you don't have sell rules and an exit plan, it's easy to freeze and not take action when needed. If your stock is soaring, you might get greedy and ignore certain sell signals and warning signs. Also, if you're sitting on a loss, you may do the ""hold and hope"" routine. You pray it bounces back  while it continues to drop. Stay grounded and keep your emotions at bay by having a selling plan in place ahead of time. Write down your target sell prices for both taking profits and cutting losses.
4. **Don't let a decent gain turn into a loss.** If you have a nice gain of, say, 10%, 15% or more and the stock begins to decline, don't let that profit disappear completely. It's much less frustrating to see a 15%-20% gain turn into a 5%-10% profit than to see it turn into a 10% loss.

2024-07-15,1721009504.0,Sofi appears to be breaking out ,"The stock market just gave us the green light on Sofi. I have seen this type of movie play out too many times. I'm no technical analysis expert and I don't know most of what the terms mean, but I can intuitively see patterns from seeing this type of movie play out so many times.

1. The stock market often times appears to treat individual stocks with a herd mindset. When a stock finally breaks out, everyone jumps on. You have seen this play out so many times. Hims, Robinhood, and even Apple's reversal fro m$170 to $230 which has no business trading at such valuation. It seems like a stock stays beaten down, until the stock market collectively decides ""ok it's this stocks turn to have it's moment of glory"". I saw this happen last year with lyft, with google, with draftkings, with carvana, and this year with apple. And many more examples I cant remember off the top of my head.
2. Momentum and trend reversal is very real. This is the type of stock where you try to time the bottom, you miss the bottom and think it will fall again, and then it ends up never looking back.  Again, I don't know much about technical analysis, but Sofi seems to have broke out of its slump. It has been setting off higher highs and lower lows.
3. Sofi has a odd price movement that 100% mimics and reacts to rate cut news. Go and see what happened to the stock when the market was expecting 5 rate cuts for 2024. Well, it seems like we have booked 1 rate cut for the year, and sofi rocketed up this last week. Momentum is a real phenomenon and usually when a stock breaks out, it doesn't end there. The story around sofi and other small cap stock have shifted.
4. To expand on point #3. The stock market follows themes. Every once in a while we get a shift in theme. Right now, the theme has shifted that there will be a rotation into small caps. and therefore the narrative around sofi has shifted. In the short term, market doesn't care about fundamentals or p/e ratios or any of that. Right now, Sofi is a beaten down stock and the narrative has shifted. Its a ""relatively undervalued"" stock that has taken a beat down and of course the market makers will run it up, and the WSB'ers will follow.
5. The market makers like to run up an under the radar stock and bring in all the WSB'ers. More options buying/selling. More profits. You see this theme over and over and over again. Rivian was at $20 last year. Then it crashed and burned. Then they pulled it back out of the grave and now everyone is talking about rivian again, when nothing fundamental has changed.

This stock may run up to $7.5 or $8 ahead of earnings in 2 weeks. And may result in $9 or $10 with a surprise beat or guidance raise. They already raised full year guidance last earnings call, but somehow the market didn't like that they lowered guidance for this specific quarter. Makes no sense.

Disclosure: I used to own sofi, until I sold for a $15k loss two months ago due to opportunity cost. I always knew it would bounce back, and with dumb luck I more than made up for it. However, I may consider buying call options tomorrow, since the wash out period has ended and I can claim the loss on my taxes for the previous loss, and I can re-enter the stock again.

2024-07-17,1721208050.0,Am I missing something?,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I dont understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted?

2024-07-18,1721300626.0,TSMC second-quarter profit beats expectations as AI chip boom continues ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the second quarter, as demand for advanced chips used in AI applications continue to surge.

Here are TSMCs second-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), vs. NT$657.58 billion expected

Net income: NT$247.85 billion, vs. NT$238.8 billion LSEG SmartEstimate weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate

TSMC reported net revenue rose 40.1% from a year ago to NT$673.51 billion, while net income increased 36.3% from a year ago to NT$247.85 billion. The firm guided second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei in an earnings call on Thursday said business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for its industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, though it was offset by continuous smartphone seasonality.

Explosive demand for AI has stretched chip supplies. TSMC is the worlds main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, though rivals such as Samsung and Intel have been trying to challenge its dominance. It counts Apple and Nvidia among its clientele.

I also try to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot. Today, the demand is so high I had to work very hard to meet customer demand, Wei told analysts.

The supply continues to be pretty tight, all the way through 2025, Wei warned, adding that the firm hopes the tight supply can ease in 2026.

The chip giant currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips.

Development of 2-nanometer technology is progressing well and is on track for volume production in 2025, said TSMC. 

For the third quarter, the business is expected to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand, said Wei, adding that they continue to expect 2024 to be a strong growth year for TSMC.

TSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. This compares to $17.3 billion in revenue posted in the same period a year ago.

For its capital budget this year, the firm is narrowing the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, versus a previous forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion. Out of this budget, 70% to 80% will go toward advanced technologies.

We are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support customers, Wei said.

The firm further added that it is not ruling out the possibility of converting more N5 technology into N33 technology to meet the strong demand for 3-nanometer chips.

TSMC shares closed 2.43% lower on Thursday, as Asian chip stocks tumbled on the back of a U.S. tech sell-off sparked by reports that Washington is considering tighter export curbs.

Big AI demand

Surging demand for advanced chips used in AI applications has boosted TSMCs Taiwan-listed shares by nearly 70% so far this year.

The demand for generative AI is surging in the cloud and at the edge. TSMCs N3 process boasts good yield rates and well-managed production lines. The market is well-funded, and regional political factors drive increased demand for advanced processes, Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, said on Friday ahead of the results.

Wang said the capacity of the 3-nanometer process is expected to more than double in 2024 compared to the previous year.

Needham analysts on Monday said they expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth target, reiterating a buy rating and raising the price target to $210 from $168 on the chip giants U.S.-listed shares.

We expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth outlook from low- to mid-20s to mid- to high-20s but maintain its 2024 [capital expenditures] target at $30 billion on the upcoming earnings call, Needham said in a note.

TSMC held 62% of global foundry market share in the first quarter, up from 59% in the same period a year ago, according to Counterpoint Research data.

2024-07-18,1721309203.0,RDDT is going to crush its next 2 earnings and you are overlooking it,"**""B-but reddit sucks and fuck spez... amirite?""** Yeah yeah yeah, it's super cool to hate on Reddit as a Redditor.

That doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.

**""But Reddit has never made a profit""** - Yes, low expectations are why this is an opportunity. As dumb as it sounds, Reddit has never *tried* to be profitable. This is changing as they are now a public company with fiduciary responsibility.

1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest. They are beginning to **finally** enable effective target marketing based on user interests, demographics, etc. **Remember, Reddit user interests and hobbies are neatly sorted into what subreddits they are subscribed to, visit, and their comment history.** I can feed an AI a Reddit user's comment history and it will create a pretty accurate profile of their interests, hobbies, age, location, and problems. **This is a medium absolutely RIPE for advertising, and Reddit's recent partnership with OpenAI WILL be leveraged for both target marketing and advertisement creation.**
2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers. 
3. **Reddit user growth 37% YoY -** Reddit's partnership with Google is serving up Reddit to normies in swathes. People who might not have been aware of it have been using it for research, opinions, hobbies, etc. Many of these people will, and are, being pulled in as full reddit users. **I caught my normie wife using reddit for her crafting hobbies and pregnancy products research. People are appending ""reddit"" to their Google searches because they crave authentic human discussion**. This is not even mentioning short term catalysts for people visiting reddit for human discussion: *2024 US presidential election and associated turmoil*
4. **Reddit user demographics -** Reddit is inherently commercial. People discuss purchases, hobbies, and interests constantly. Its users are also largely high income individuals in 1st world countries between the ages of 18 to 40. This is the most valuable demographic for advertisers, as these people actually have discretionary spending ability.
5. **Reddit's moat and competitive advantage** - Reddit's collection of communities and cultures spanning almost every interest has kept it growing steadily for over a decade. No other single platform beats it for ANY individual to find several communities that meet their interests in one place, share news, participate in authentic human discussion, and access a treasure trove of questions asked by users over the past decade. Reddit doesn't always have the best answers to questions, but its discussions are largely real people sharing honest opinions, and that has a lot of value.

-----------Long term bull cases----------

**6. AI Data Deals** - AI is getting more advanced and will rapidly continue to do so for the next decade. Reddit contains 15 years of human discussion on every topic imaginable, and it is constantly building its data for every fresh topic. This is a valuable data source for LLM training, and there could be growth in this sector. **""B-But pizza glue"" -** We are still in the early stages, and the pros will outweigh the cons long term.

**7. Reddit Marketplace** - It's only a matter of time before reddit facilitates C2B and C2C transactions for its many hobbies and interests. There is money to be made there.

8. **Meme stock potential -** Reddit has made the news countless times. For the past few years, it has become a meme stock generator attracting the attention of institutions and retail investors alike. If it starts to spike, which it will, I can see the potential for a ""meme buy-in"" of a stock like RDDT.

9. **Acquisition** - If big tech decides to acquire reddit for any number of good reasons, you win as a shareholder as they will pay a premium.

10. **International expansion and AI translation -** Reddit is investing heavily in using AI to translate all content as human readable across all languages, with the goal of connecting people internationally and expanding its audience internationally. There is a shit ton of money to be made internationally and it is only a matter of time before this occurs.

**""When is the next earnings call?""** - August 6th. I think this has the potential to crush, and the following one in early November will have even more potential.

**Similar company valuation comparison:** I believe the following valuations are FAIR for how much revenue has been reported recently, but I believe it does not account for what will be a big surge in RDDT revenue. Reddit will easily meet the valuation of Pinterest, making it 3x. Longer term, I see 8x-10x.

**RDDT - 10.6bil**

**PINTEREST - 28bil**

**SNAP - 24bil**

**""Okay what's your position then?""**

2024-07-22,1721656544.0,Berkshire trims Bank of America stake for the first time since 2019 ,"Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its gigantic Bank of America holding for the first time in four and a half years following the banks strong 2024 run.

Warren Buffetts conglomerate sold 33.9 million shares of Bank of America shares for almost $1.5 billion in separate sales on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at an average selling price of $43.56, a regulatory filing showed.

It marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019 that the Omaha-based conglomerate has reduced the stake. Still, Bank of America remains Berkshires second largest equity position after Apple, holding 999 million shares with a market value of almost $43 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire is still Bank of Americas largest shareholder with a 10.8% stake.

Berkshire could be taking some profits as Bank of America has rallied 27.4% so far this year to its highest levels since March 2022. In the first quarter, Buffett trimmed Berkshires Apple holding by 13% for tax reasons following sizable gains.

Shares of Bank of America dipped slightly on Monday following the news.

Bathtub idea

The Oracle of Omahas purchase of Bank of America has become one of the most endearing Wall Street tales. In 2011, the legendary investor bought $5 billion worth of the banks preferred stock and warrants to shore up confidence in the lender as it grappled with losses related to subprime mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Buffett later revealed that he got the idea while taking a bath in his tub.

Incidentally, that BofA purchase, it literally was true that I was sitting in the bathtub when I got the idea of checking with ... BofA, whether theyd be interested in that preferred, he said at Berkshires annual meeting in 2017, when he first converted the warrants and added the bank stock to his portfolio.

The 93-year-old investor said he was attracted to CEO Brian Moynihans leadership and the profit-generating abilities of the franchise.

Moynihan later recalled that Buffett initially tried to reach him through Bank of Americas public phone line, but got rejected by the call center. Despite the snafu, the deal still came together within hours, he said.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based holding company sold another 18.9 million shares via transactions on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at an average price of $42.46, raising $802.5 million, a new regulatory filing showed.

Over the last six trading sessions, Berkshire has unloaded 52.8 million Bank of America shares worth $2.3 billion, reducing the stake to 12.5%. Berkshire still owns 980.1 million Bank of America shares with a market value of $41.3 billion, a distant second to its $172.5 billion holding in Apple.

They are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably wont do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.

Amazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesnt make much sense.

They are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. 

Their PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.

E.g.

I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment

The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600

I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACBs for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows

16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share
1 AMD = about $90/share

MSFT trading at $410
AMD trading at $178

Essentially since I didnt add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.

Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what ive put in as net investments.

2023-12-24,1703422215.0,REITs vs SP500 vs dividend delusion,"I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.

Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.

I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was £16.43. This year is £900 range and next year projected £1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.

But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding
Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.

Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided

Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you £45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is £11,880


Year 1 
264 shares +£45 dividend monthly
Month 1 
264+45
Month 2
265+45.05
Month 3
266+45.22
Month 4
267+45.39
Month 5
268+45.56
Month 6
269+45.73
Month 7
270+45.9
Month 8
271+46.07
Month 9
272+46.24
Month 10
273 +46.41
Month 11
274 +46.58
Month 12
275 +46.75

1 year from 
264 shares =11,880

To
11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236
+reinvested shares 11 =495
=12,731
7.2% growth

But if invested in growth stock 
11,880 +20%

Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying 

Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early

2024-01-07,1704663804.0,How can I use correlation coefficients to build a portfolio,"Hi all,

Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.

So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate. 

I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:

https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php

It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between. 

Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do. 

However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85. 

Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?

So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?

A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available. 

Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason. 

And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?",investing,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1913hfc/how_can_i_use_correlation_coefficients_to_build_a/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9958639144897461
2024-01-08,1704736916.0,Rebalancing Portfolio Suggestions,"I decided to really start investing about a decade ago. I opened a Roth IRA and have fully funded it every year. I contribute 5% of my check to a 403(b) that is matched at 10%. I had no credit card debt. I have an emergency fund (HYSA). Car is paid for. Small amount left on a 15 year fixed house loan at around 3%. I put $8,400 into a ""catch up"" Roth 403(b) a year.  

Seven years ago I had some money to invest that I could afford to lose, so I put it in APPL. This is now roughly 45% of my portfolio. This is too high and no longer in the realm of money I can afford to lose.  

I was thinking of selling some of the AAPL each year to finish out the Roth 403(b). I'm in my 50s so can contribute up to $30k a year. I make ~$70k a year.  

It would literally take me like ten or eleven years to sell all of my AAPL stock at this rate, but it seems like a great way to reduce my taxable income and to lock in some long term gains.

LOW      8.5% NIM    29% ROC

AMGN   28.% NIM    10.9% ROC

These two names provide a good contrast in NIM vs ROC. Both trade at a reasonable multiple.

I've done well in capital intensive companies like Chevron, Exxon, UPS, and Olin. But I can't ignore what I've learned most recently about ROC. The obvious example of a smashing success with good ROC is Apple.

Interestingly, BRKA has 22% NIM and 9.8% ROC. Buffet has extolled the virtues of ROC, but his company puts up better numbers in net income than return on capital.

I can look at numbers all day. The thing I'm asking you folks about is the ""Why?"" Why would I choose excellent ROC over average NIM and vice versa.

, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company.

Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).

And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.

2024-01-18,1705612380.0,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment

On another note, Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count.

2024-04-18,1713450254.0,Will NVDA Bounce Back,"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead.",wallstreetbets,52.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c74nbv/will_nvda_bounce_back/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9993098974227905
2024-04-18,1713457789.0,"Discount Stocks I'm buying: EA, BMBL, TSLA, RIVN, MCD, SBUX","BMBL  
Current price $10.3
Target price $18.25
No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users dont pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next years earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   Im a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldnt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the companys main expense (advertising). 

EA
Current Price $126
Target Price $148
Avg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS"" College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  Ive been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  

RIVN
Current price $8.92
Target Price: $9.58+
This stock is now trading below its cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells its trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Dont make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think its worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so dont be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely dont short this stock).  

TSLA
Current price $150.6
Target Price $294
Honestly Im ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that Ive had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk whos smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friends Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, youll have Tesla robotaxis.  Youll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and itll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. Thats a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and thats 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and Im buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next years earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And Im willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonalds and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.

All cool things do come back, and in this case its the H5N1 or bird flu virus. Take a few minutes to google H5N1 and youll see growing concerns over the worldwide spread, including in the US, where it has now spread into the dairy supply. While the virus so far has not jumped much to humans, the known fatality rate is 50%, and it has been confirmed in some dairy workers so far in Texas. Many experts are worried, and it could be a great opportunity for you to be on the right side of a leap. ([massive amount of vaccines would be needed](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/24/h5n1-bird-flu-vaccine-preparedness/)preparedness/)

2024-04-29,1714353757.0,$AMZN Earnings Tuesday,"I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:

# Continuing to Cut Costs

Amazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.

# AI Strategy

Amazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.

# Prime Day

Prime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.

# NBA Rights

Amazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.

# Investors Over Employees

Andy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.

# Summary / tl;dr

It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later.

2024-05-02,1714685658.0,Snowflake isn't worth $50 Billion Dollars,"THESIS:
The issue with snowflake is that theyre a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework. 

However, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex data science tasks because most data needs to be engineered before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.

This post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:

- Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose distributed computing framework or distributed compute runtime.
- Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to spark in benchmarks
- Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data 
   - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial





THE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:

- ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlos Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~


- My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility
- Misleading promotional information for investors
- My (limited) experience using the product
- Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)

DISCLOSURE: 

- Ive held a long short position(&lt;$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move. 
- FWIW, I dont hold individual stocks; my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts. 
- I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.

MY CLAIMS: 

- Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers
- Snowflakes valuation should be closer to Vercels, in $5 - $10 billion range.

2024-05-04,1714826281.0,Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon,"Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. Im currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Lets be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we dont blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you dont execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder why you didnt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesnt mean youre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didnt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that Im going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them.

2024-05-04,1714833933.0,Pezempic aka Celsius DD Party ,"All right boys, here it is the DD to end all DDs.

If you pay attention, you might find yourself floating in a green field enjoying the results of your multibagger getting that divorce you've always wanted and in a position for the first time in your life to not have to ask your wife's boyfriend for an allowance.

The play this week is 100% Celsius. Ticker symbol celh.

Google it regards. 

Why do you want to put your entire portfolio into this on Monday? I'll tell you. 

Firstly, this stuff is literally liquid cocaine. I know every single one of you have done cocaine and you all loved it. 
Imagine cocaine in liquid form. This is it. Sales Bros. Everywhere are crushing these things so they can stay awake and hit 40% of their quota.  Managers are crushing these things so they can ask how many dials their teams are making and why they haven't hit their number 3 days into the month.

But here's the rub. It's not just the sales Bros that are getting forced back into the office due to regarded RTO policies anymore. I mean don't get me wrong. That's a big reason why you should be going full port on its own offices are stocking the s*** up like crazy and it's flying off the shelves. But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. 

Secondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. 

I'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.

Thirdly, they're going international. 
They announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. 

Finally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.

That's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. 

That alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.

Now here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. 

Tuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market.

I don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD, Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.

Here is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.

GPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief, Demis Hassabis, and I quote, "" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora."" And that's ALL GPU's folks.

2024-07-26,1721963681.0,The media came up with new bullshit: the great rotation.,"I've been seeing the idea of a great rotation floating around -- there's a major shift happening. The funds have started to sell off big-cap stocks and instead buy small-cap. But is this just more bullshit designed to drive clicks?

The idea originated when SPY had an unusually bad day at the same time that the Russell 2000 -- an index tracking small-cap stocks -- surged 10% in a week. However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.

However, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. 

What if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. 

If these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trendit's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.

Given how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go onjust maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.",wallstreetbets,71.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ecdxle/the_media_came_up_with_new_bullshit_the_great/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.999082088470459

Simply put, both Google and Anthropic use Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to train both of these models.

OpenAI relied on expensive and power-hungry NVIDIA chips, spending $100 million and several years of training to launch an expensive GPT-4 model that most regular free users couldn't access. In less than a year, Anthropic and Google easily surpassed them, launching models superior to GPT-4 at a cost 10 times cheaper, with training costs also 10 times lower and only taking a few months.

The situation with general-purpose GPU chips for AI training is similar to using them for Bitcoin mining in 2014 - expensive, energy-consuming, and wastefully space-occupying, until Bitcoin difficulty increased to the point where NVIDIA GPUs became useless and ASIC Bitcoin miners emerged to replace them. Therefore, thinking that NVIDIA will monopolize the AI chip market is just the thinking of Wall Street traders who only know companies through Bloomberg articles and have no expertise in the field.

Thanks to NVIDIA's expensive and inefficient GPUs, a basic user paying $20/month can still only access GPT-4 in a limited and expensive way, while Google is providing FREE API access to their FLAGSHIP MODEL, Gemini-1.5-Pro. Remember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't even the flagship model, but just an inexpensive mid-tier model. Claude 3.5 Opus will be released and it will surpass GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 thanks to NOT USING NVIDIA GPUs.

Reddit has 1/3 the market cap of Snap and Pinterest. Sure those companies are more mature and have much larger revenues but Reddit is soooo much a better investment. First, Reddit has no competition. Snap or Pinterest can easily get their lunch eaten by Tiktok or whatever next trendy app comes along. Meanwhile even the true regards over at r/RedditAlternatives have thrown in the towel and admit there's no alternative to Reddit. Of course reddit is never gonna compete with Insta or Tiktok due to low quality userbase (yeah I'm talking about you) and a medium less conducive to advertising. But it doesn't matter! Reddit only need to be 1/20th of meta for us to get rich.

Reddit is only gonna keep growing like the chode your wife loves so much. They got Google sending them giga traffic because of all the BS AI articles trying to game the search system. They got OpenAI about to start referencing reddit in their results. They got AI translation for their entire content to other languages for international expansion in testing.

Best part is how bad the current advertising on Reddit is. Some people say this is a negative but it's not, that's what makes this such an opportunity. I've seen how dog water Reddit ads were targeted a few years ago. Now it's merely bad. You're telling me they can't at least make it decent after a while? When communities are already separated by topic?

Half the analysts I see talk about Reddit on TV have no idea what's going on or what the site is other than it's an old school forum that's bad at selling ads. This screams opportunity, 5x is much more likely than 50%.

2024-07-04,1720112938.0,Nvidia to make $12bn from AI chips in China this year despite US controls,"Paywall-removed version for the poors (including myself) below. You know, in case any berrs still had an ounce of hope after the Nancy news.

https://www.ft.com/content/b76ef55b-21cd-498b-ac16-5660908bb8d2

_Nvidia is on course to sell $12bn worth of artificial intelligence chips in China this year despite US export controls that have throttled its business in one of the worlds biggest semiconductor markets.
The $3tn Silicon Valley group will over the coming months deliver more than 1mn of its new H20 chips, which are designed to fall outside of US restrictions on selling AI processors to Chinese customers, according to analyst forecasts._

_That figure is almost twice as many as Huawei is expected to sell of its China-made rival product, Ascend 910B, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis, a chip consultancy._

_Nvidia is the latest Silicon Valley company to find itself entangled in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Biden administration wants to stem the flow of the worlds most powerful chips to China, fearing Beijing may use them to create more powerful AI systems with military applications._

_The resulting shortage of AI chips has hit the ability of Chinese tech groups such as ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba to compete with US-based OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and Google in a technology that is reshaping the industry._

_Each H20 chip costs between $12,000 and $13,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate upwards of $12bn in sales. That would be more than the $10.3bn revenue made from its entire China business  including selling graphics chips to PC gamers and other products  in the financial year ending in January 2024._

_Nvidia declined to comment on the forecasts. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
Ever since the Biden administration first introduced restrictions on Nvidias ability to sell its most powerful AI chips in China in 2022, the US company has warned that its business would suffer as cloud computing providers and AI start-ups there turned to local alternatives such as Huawei._

_Our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past, Jensen Huang, Nvidias chief executive, said during the companys most recent earnings call in May. And its a lot more competitive in China now, because of the limitations on our technology	.	.	.	However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there.
Colette Kress, Nvidias finance chief, said on the same call that revenue from its data centre segment  which includes AI chips  in China in the latest quarter was down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October._

_As recently as 2021, before the US began imposing export controls, China accounted for more than a quarter of Nvidias total revenues. Even if the H20 chip sells as well as analysts expect, China could be closer to 10 per cent of sales this year. But that also reflects the huge growth that Nvidia is seeing from US tech companies as they build out ever-larger AI systems._

_Although Nvidias sales in China have been lower ahead of the rollout of the new H20 this spring, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and SemiAnalysis say that the chip is now being shipped in volume and is proving popular with Chinese customers, despite its downgraded performance compared with the chips Nvidia can sell in the US._

_Buyers report positive feedback on the potential competitiveness of H20 clusters, Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to clients this week, pointing to strong China demand._

2024-05-05,1714936401.0,Reddit(RDDT) earnings this week. Get in while you still can. ,"Am I trying to pump this stock? Maybe. Does Drake have a daughter? Allegedly 

But for real. Reddit is the 3rd most visited website in the United States. It's market cap is only at $7 billion. CAVA, a company that sells albeit, pretty good mediterranean food bowls, has a market cap of $8 billion. 



Why is Reddit worth so little, when similar companies like Pinterest and Twitter are worth 5X that? 

Because they haven't historically advertised as well or as much, and don't have other successful cash generating products like premium accounts and marketplace platforms. 



How much of the traffic is bots? 

Let's gamble and find out. 



What's the upside?

1. There's so little downside to taking the risk. The company's not going to drop that much below it's current market cap. 
2. The company is easily one of the most influential platforms for the foreseeable future. The opportunity to build cash generating products on top of it are endless. 
3. Google search engine recently updated it's algorithm to promote user generated counted, increasing Reddit's traffic exponentially. 

  
What's the downside?

The only thing I don't like is that Reddit's Executive Team owns a large majority of shares. I think this will be a barrier for allowing Reddit to innovate and monetize.

**Why I'm still bullish on Reddit**

* Reddit continues to optimize it's ad space, making it more appealing for marketers. See improvements on conversational and comment ads.
* Reddit's marketing efforts since IPO has increased dramatically. The quality and quantity of ads has increased as well. I've collected data consistently on multiple accounts, tracking advertisements from companies for all age, gender, and interest groups. Since ad space is run on a bidding system, it's highly likely the the average price spent per ad has increased.
* Reddit recently partnered with OpenAI in another data licensing deal. While the financials haven't been released, this definitely puts Reddit on the map even further for other companies in the AI and advertising space.
   * Reddit also increased security, preventing web scraping. Which could increase API purchases.
* WSB - YES YOU APES!!! The subreddit has exploded this quarter. While you guys and gals might have only contributed to a few percentage point increases in DAU - the amount of financial institutions(trade station, bof, etc) bidding on ads has likely increased exponentially. Tbd on how much you all impacted earnings for Q2.
* Not important but still noteworthy. Reddit re-released awards this quarter. I've been tracking award usage across hundreds of subreddits, and my conclusion is that it's not likely this will be adding significant boosts to earnings.

**Possible risks**

* Last quarter, Reddit experienced record DAU. Advertising revenue grew pretty much equivalent to DAU increase. We might see DAU yoy increase stay the same as Q1, assuming not too much has changed in Google SEO this quarter. Which could mean that Advertising growth is going to just meet expectations.

**Summary**

Reddit has potential to hit +$30b market cap by eoy. It's possible that we see 80-100% yoy revenue growth by Q4. It's currently trading at about 10 p/s, with a very healthy balance sheet - which imo, is actually slightly below where it should be.",wallstreetbets,81.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e1ig4k/reddit_rddt_upcoming_q2_earnings_dd_this_is_just/,Other,POSITIVE,0.956630527973175

In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMCs performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.*

*TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.*

*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with ""the most powerful AI chip on the surface"" will open a new page in the AI industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*

*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*

*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the ""most powerful AI chip on the planet"". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*

*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*

*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*

*According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million.

This is not financial advice, it's actually the easiest DD that I think Ive ever seen and I keep waiting for someone else to see what I see and post about it (because Im a lurker, not a poster. But above all Im here for sweet tendies). Ive invested in this company on and off since c. 2018 and recently have seen a big uptick in interest thanks to our GOAT friend AI. For whatever reason, even with this increased interest, I continue to add to my positions waiting and waiting for someone to make the connection& But in the words of the Great Bill OReilly Fuck it, well do it live!

 \*\*Key Point/ Secret Sauce First, Disclaimer, TLDR, additional comments/DD, sources at end\*\*

**Key Point/ Secret Sauce:**

Were all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, its a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations& \[1\]

More and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \[2\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \[3\], WEF \[4\], Yale \[5\]& etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power. 

SMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (youll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor. 

IMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \~$3b.

That doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.

1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest.

2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers.

So back with more DD on what am buying after reading motivating comments to continue sharing. (Those are *NOT* price targets, it's the current price.)

**Chipotle $53.48** \- Expecting 7%-10% move to upside, $50 to act as strong support if move to downside. I've opened calendars at $50, $55 (to sell before earning's), and $60. Ratio 3-1-3 so the ATM $55 cals just to pay off some of the risk, to sell *before* earning's. Extremely cheap cals with very high reward. This is what I look for. Win on one side totally offsets losses of other side. Expecting price $57-$59.

**Google $179.39** \- Expecting 10% move to the upside or flat, the market sold off heavily this week but Google was largely unaffected in-comparison. I've opened calendars at $170, $185, $200. Ratio 1-3-4 so the ATM $185 cals will sell half before earning's and others to hold through. If dumps downside protection $170 will cover some of the cost the other cals. This is my big play of the week.

**Vertiv $85.28** \- Expecting $80 to act like solid support, the next earning's will be their best quarter yet. It all comes down to forward guidance. I've opened $80 and $100 strike cals, may close everything before earning's as this company is too volatile to predict where jump will be or if trades flat. Jumps are 25% over the week which would put this around $110 pushing past its strong resistance of $105.

**American Airlines $10.61** \- Same story as Delta, should have good quarter compared to past quarters and report good earning's just like Delta and then sell off 3% barley moving up or down cause it's a boring not very volatile company.

2024-07-23,1721763812.0,Why GOOG calls are in the bag today,"Today TSLA is doing their earnings so all eyes on them, but seriously tho, GOOG is releasing theirs too and it's important that we all fucking come together and look into this. WSB is about good DD, right?

Heres what analysts are expecting:

*Earnings per share: $1.84

*Revenue: $84.19 billion

There are a few other numbers expected in the report:

* YouTube advertising revenue: $8.93 billion

* Google Cloud revenue: $10.20 billion

* Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.54 billion

This company has really outperformed other internet and software mega caps through the year, so I think they can keep posting steady growth. I expect modest growth in key areas such as cloud and overall revenue, after a quarter of massive leadership moves, AI announcements and market expansions.

Let's take a look at what's been going on during the second quarter. Alphabet saw a number of expansion updates, including for its self-driving car unit Waymo, which opened its service to all San Francisco users. The move was Waymos second citywide rollout, following its 2020 debut in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

In May, Alphabet held its annual developer conference, where it announced a massive number of new artificial intelligence products including a new large language model called Gemini 1.5 Flash, which can quickly summarize conversations, caption images and videos and extract data from large documents and tables. This shit makes chatGPT look weak. Yes, I will be putting glue on my pizza and I think the recommendation to try eating at least one rock per day isn't *that bad*.

The company also launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google search. 

Alphabet also announced a new DEI hire and finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, who came from Eli Lily (the worlds most valuable drugmaker). Ashkenazi begins her tenure on July 31, replacing Ruth Porat, who has taken on a new role as Alphabet president and chief investment officer.  

However, they have recently continued layoffs, getting rid of more than 100 people from several teams in Googles cloud unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses. The company also laid off at least 200 employees from its Core engineering teams moving some roles to India and Mexico. But honestly, this is just called ""being efficient."" I'm sure Indians will take over most WFH jobs by 2030, and that's just how capitalism works. 

The one issue is the cybersecurity company Wiz. On Monday they walked away from a $23 billion deal with Google. The acquisition could have really helped bolster Googles cloud unit revenue.

With that being said GOOG 7/26 200c @ 1.10 seems like a good bet. If it's a dud, it's a dud. There will be many other earning plays to throw money in.

-TSLA and GOOG/GOOGL destroyed the market out of pure happenstance that it caused a chain reaction throughout the market as a whole.

I've done a bit of reading and I think the first theory is more probable as GDP is already expected to come in lower than Q1. It won't be enough to spur on a recession as ""healthy consumer spending"" helped a slow decline. GDP will still be up at least 1.8%, I don't expect anything less but I'm also not an economist so I can't say much to that point.

2024-07-10,1720644040.0,SMMT. The needle in the stack capable of 500%,"**TLDR: Preliminary data is showing SMMT may have the real deal on their hands with the development of their drug Ivonescimab. Trial data is showing Ivonescimab has a statistically meaningful improvement over Keytruda (The best selling drug of 2023) developed by Merck. More data needs to be confirmed from other regions the trials are being conducted in, but if said data shows confirmation of these initial reports then a buyout is very likely to occur to the tune of anywhere from $40-$50/share.**

*1,000 shares at $7.24*  
*15 x Jan 2025 $15 calls*

[Link to interim study data and Ivonescimab insights](https://www.smmttx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dr-Zhang_AK112-301_2024_ASCO_Oral-Presentation.pdf)

**Bull Case:**

SMMT is developing a drug called Ivonescimab, it's a bispecific antibody that combines PD-1 and VEGF inhibition. They're in collaboration with Akeso which helps enhance research capabilities and market reach as they have one of the richest and most diversified antibody drug pipelines in China.

Currently seeing positive data from Akesos trials in China showing potential to outperform Keytruda, a drug developed by Merck that has been pretty damn successful and profitable.

They have exposure to large oncology market potential, with Ivonescimab targeting high-need areas like EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous NSCLC.

Strong cash position and clear roadmap to profitability. They just secured a significant financial boost by entering into a $200 million private placement deal with a sale of over 22 million shares at $9/share (why the price jumped in May)

Summits license territories for Ivonescimab will include Latin America, including Mexico and all countries in Central America and South America, in addition to the Middle East and Africa. This expansion adds to the territory licensed by Summit, which previously included the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe.

They have an experienced leadership team with a proven track record in drug development and commercialization. Strategic vision focused on high-growth areas in pharmaceuticals.

82% Insider ownership.

June 27 2024 they appointed Jeff Huber to their board of directors who has extensive experience and proven leadership in Biotech from his time as CEO at GRAIL as well as an SVP at Google.

**If more data comes out from other trial regions backing up the claims coming from China it's going to garnish quite an interest from institutions. At that point a buyout could be very likely and $40-$50 wouldn't be unheard of if this drug proves it's providing more meaningful improvement over Keytruda.**

**Bear Case:**

Data from China trials could be untrustworthy as data from trials in China are known to be. Would need to wait and see data coming from other regions to confirm the positive results seen thus far in China. Trials are currently being conducted in China, Canada, US, and Europe.

82% Insider ownership.

Plays like this rarely work out when in a highly competitive landscape mired with clinical and regulatory risks.

Could still take quite a while to play out. Phase III has been ongoing since 2023 and will probably continue for another 2-3 years. In that time an asteroid could crash to Earth bearing a species of highly sentient muppets that have telekinetic abilities and will enslave us all to a life of servitude entertaining them with singing the alphabet and spelling fruits.

However, there is a potential that highly bullish interim data could present itself and light this thing off.

2024-05-08,1715138488.0,Morgan Stanley hikes Price Target on Arm Artificial Intelligence CPU boost,"Is anyone seeing this or is it just me. Are we talking about TSMC here or...

Morgan Stanley analysts hiked their price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) (TSMC), citing improved prospects for the worlds biggest contract chipmaker from artificial intelligence-geared processors based on **Arm technology**. 

TSMCs price target was raised to T$928.0 from T$860.0, while Morgan Stanley analysts also maintained their overweight rating on the stock. The updated PT represents an upside of 16% from TSMCs last close of T$800.

Morgan Stanley analysts said that increased demand for processors based on British chipmaker **Arm Holdings**' (NASDAQ:[**ARM**](https://www.investing.com/equities/arm)) technology was expected to be an important growth driver for TSMC, given that the chipmaker makes almost 100% of all **Arm-based processors**. 

**Demand for Arm-based processors is expected to pick up amid increasing adoption of AI**, while TSMCs CoWoS chip packaging technology is also expected to factor into advancements in AI chip development.

Morgan Stanley expects TSMCs foundry share in global CPU markets will be close to **60% in 2028**, up from 37% in 2023, and will also become a bigger revenue driver for the firm.

Increased development of in-house, AI-geared silicon by major tech firms- such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)- also factors into improved prospects for TSMC, given that foundry work for the chips will be outsourced to the Taiwanese firm. 

AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- which is among TSMC's biggest customers- also develops its most advanced **AI chips on Arm**.

Increased demand for AI chips fueled stronger earnings from TSMC in the first quarter. But the chipmaker had also warned that AI demand may not be sufficient in offsetting a broader decline in chip demand, especially amid weaker global PC and smartphone sales. ",wallstreetbets,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cmuqp4/morgan_stanley_hikes_price_target_on_arm/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9936445951461792

2024-06-27,1719526191.0,Simec Atlantis Energy | Big turn for tidal company?,"So, I'm a long term holder aka bagholder of SAE. Got burned by the stock but kept averaging down. Today I have a comparatively large holding in the company and, since recently, that big red number isn't as red and as big anymore. 

So much for disclosure. 

SAE is a very small company by now. What used to be almost 100 employees, shrunk down to 15 or so. That's not just lay offs, it's also the fact that they sold their tidal division to a private investor. They still hold 11% though.

Anyways, the interesting part imo is that they own an old coal power plant which they are currently converting to a battery storage system. There's their tidal steam array, MeyGen, which will see an increase from 6MW to ~60MW via a revenue support schema, and another battery project connected to that tidal array, but the eye catcher for me is the Uskmouth power plant which is currently being converted to a power bank.

The interesting bit here is that from their previous lease arrangement, just Google it, brought them in £12m. That's double their yesterday's market cap btw. But if I told you that that's less than 25% of what they can make to income here l, then it becomes rather interesting if we acknowledge that this would cover almost their entire debt that they took on as they, among other things, invested into the power plant years ago.

So, in the end, we can view the company as virtually debt free. 

Additionally, their revenue stabilizes and they keep winning in the UK Contracts for Difference scheme.

All this is really the short version but to get the point across: simplywall.st estimates the value at 48 GBX which would be +24,000% from their current valuation of 2 GBX which makes me wonder, if there is a big opportunity to get more shares. 

The news about the £12m for the Uskmouth lease is out for months, if not years, by now. I always felt like there's dots to connect. How was it possible for the market not to reflect the fact that this deal is proof that their equity is ridiculously under valued.

And that's what we finally see in their latest report. It's not rosy, by no means, but from my angle this is a complete turnaround. A well deserved one but please make up your own mind here.

My question and/or discuss point here is if a higher valuation seems realistic at this point. Their market valuation just jumped from £6m to £12m which is nothing, to say the least. However, this can't be a fair value for this company. I'd like to express my doubts here. My only explanation is that this stock went unnoticed for a very long time now. It's not a huge company but, in the end, they are world leader in delivering tidal stream energy by a considerable margin and, from their current stance, I'd argue that they have lots of opportunities ahead.

Whatever you do, DYOR. This company certainly had a difficult phase in the past. But to me this was primarily politics and didn't have anything to do with whether or not the company was able to deliver. 

For anyone interested, here's their latest RNS with their latest yearly report attached:

I follow a guy on Instagram. I used to follow him for a specific content (plants). The guy was poor and was trying to make money from Instagram and YouTube.

He then sold his house, travelled a lot, and followed a specific program to learn how to trade. He claimed he made 200k with Forex, then he started crypto. I saw through Instagram every progress he made, first the trips, then he made a home gym, then he bought two expensive cars, went to the Maldives, opened up a café, bought a new home and his last investment is a crypto blog, where with a subscription of 25 pounds/month, he tells you what to trade. All this in 1.5 years. 

Of course I know how social media works. But the guy is showing live and with screenshots all the money he makes, the car is too personalised to be borrowed,  the trips are real, and there is something about him, following him from poor to rich that is admirable and addictive. I read about crypto and trading online, and everyone says it's not the best idea, eventually you will lose money. 

Since he made the blog with a subscription, I am'extremely tempted to join and invest money. I definitely have some thousands I could invest. I love my job, have a high salary and definitely want to continue it. But there is something so tempting about it, and this guy has a print on me, I even dreamt of meeting him and joining his blog. There is a specific link to the blog, I can't read comments on Google.

2024-07-12,1720752169.0,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy.

  
But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o.



So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

  
### Future

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors.

Market pulled back, but I don't think the bean-counters have fully understood the extent of this damage. Repairing the issue is not something you can do remotely, it literally requires a physical person to access the machine, reboot it in safe-mode and delete some files one machine at a time. If your machine uses Bitlocker encryption, you need to make sure you have the Bitlocker backup key to every single one of those machines. 

So you have an update that auto-deployed on a bunch of Windows machines that requires manual 1-at-a-time intervention to fix. Have we ever had an incident on this scale? I expect markets to dip for a while from the fallout of this.

Anyone know any ways to model this? VTI barely pulled back from this, but I expect there to be significantly more fallout as time passes.

2024-06-20,1718917643.0,"My Thesis on IonQ
","Hey there! So, I've been looking into IonQ and it's pretty exciting stuff. Let me fill you in on why it might be a smart investment compared to something like NVIDIA, which has already had a big run-up in stock price.

# Stock Performance

First off, IonQ's stock has been all over the place lately. It hit a high of $21.58 last September but has since settled around $7.55. This kind of volatility can be nerve-wracking, but it's also where the potential for big gains lies. Analysts think it could go up to between $11.50 and $21.00, so theres definitely room for growth.

# What's New with IonQ?

IonQ just hit a major milestone way ahead of schedule: their #AQ 35 benchmark. This basically means their quantum computers can handle really complex problems, and they're getting better at it faster than expected. The market loved this news, and its a big reason why people are optimistic about their stock.

# Management Changes

Theyve also made some smart moves with their leadership. Peter Chapman is now the Chairman of the Board, and Stacey Giamalis is the new Chief Legal Officer. These are seasoned pros who are expected to drive the companys strategy and growth. Plus, theyve teamed up with big names like Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on cool projects like improving the US power grid with quantum tech.

# Industry Positioning

IonQ is the only quantum computing company available on all the major cloud platformsAmazon Braket, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This means theyre super accessible and have a wide reach across different industries like logistics, finance, and even pharma. They're not just in the game; they're making big plays.

# Financials

Financially, IonQ is looking solid. They made $7.6 million in Q1 2024, which is a 77% increase from last year. Theyve got a lot of cash on hand$434.4 millionso theyre in a good position to keep pushing their tech forward. Sure, they reported a net loss of $39.6 million, but that's pretty typical for a company investing heavily in its future.

# Why IonQ Over NVIDIA?

Now, why consider IonQ over NVIDIA? Well, NVIDIA is a giant in the GPU and AI market, and their stock has already skyrocketed. If youre looking for something with high growth potential, IonQ might be the way to go. Heres why:

1. **Early-Stage Growth**: IonQ is still in the early stages of its growth, whereas NVIDIA is more established. This means there's more potential for IonQ's stock to take off as quantum computing becomes more mainstream.
2. **Quantum Leap**: Quantum computing is set to revolutionize many industries, and IonQ is leading the charge. NVIDIA is great, but theyre not in the quantum space the way IonQ is.
3. **Valuation**: IonQs stock is relatively undervalued compared to NVIDIAs, giving you a better entry point if you believe in the long-term potential of quantum computing.

In summary, IonQ is at the cutting edge of a transformative technology. Their recent achievements, strategic leadership changes, and strong financial position make them a compelling investment opportunity, especially compared to more mature companies like NVIDIA. If you're looking for something with high potential and are okay with a bit of risk, IonQ could be a smart move.",wallstreetbets,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dkmiva/my_thesis_on_ionq/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9522701501846313

Enter Immunity Bio. Please forgive this long post.

This is a deep dive. I would not dare insult your intelligence. There have been a couple posts on this stock already, but I feel like none of them do justice to why ANKTIVA, the drug recently approved by the FDA for bladder cancer treatment in concert with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is a big deal from a technical perspective, as well as a financial perspective. Let me elucidate.

First, some context.[ In 2020 a study was released by the National Cancer Institute estimating the annual financial burden of cancer treatment to be around 209 billion dollars in the US.](https://progressreport.cancer.gov/after/economic_burden) Why do we spend so much treating it?[ Because cancer fucking kills.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20was%20the%20leading,causes%20and%20increased%20for%201) Heart disease overtook cancer as leading cause of death globally,[ but cancer is a close second](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20causes%20of%20death%20globally%20%E2%80%94%20shown%20in%20blue,and%20aren't%20infectious%20themselves). So, cancer is a big deal. We all probably know someone who has gotten cancer, or maybe even passed away from cancer. Rest in peace.

[Of the various types of cancer](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/common.html), speaking only of the US, breast cancer has the highest annual rate of diagnosis, followed by prostate, then lung, and eventuallynumber 6bladder cancer, with around 83,000 new cases every year.  Around 16840 people die from it in the US annually. [Globally](https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/worldwide-cancer-data/) speaking, bladder cancer is the 10th leading cause of cancer in the world. Approximately 573,000 new cases a year globally. Around 212000 people die from it globally, on an annual basis.

We dont want those people to die. Or at least I dont want those people to die. So what are the treatment options?

Current treatments: There is no cure for canceryet. Our best attempt at treating cancer involves a [multi-faceted approach with many variables](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types): patients age, patients overall health, how pervasive is the cancermore commonly what stage is it in, the mitotic rate (rate of growth) of the tumor, drug allergies/restrictions, chance of recurrence, the list goes on. Chemotherapy as a treatment, for example, is common knowledge at this point. It basically involves flooding the patients body with a cocktail of harsh drugs that target and kill dividing cells. Since cancerous cells grow and divide at a much faster rate than other cells, on average, they also die at a much faster rate from chemo. Unfortunately though, the rest of our cells also divide (some a lot, like hair follicles). Chemo does not discriminate, thats why chemo hurts. [Here is a good ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/11vchtr/eli5_how_does_chemotherapy_work/).

For bladder cancer, I will just list the various treatment modalities available. Some are done in tandem. Some are done in lieu of. Treatment methodologies can vary widely from patient to patient for the aforementioned reasons, and can change as the disease progresses or regresses. This is not financial advice, and this is sure as shit not medical advice:

[TURBT](https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/treatment/by-stage#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20stages%20II%20and,and%20surrounding%20tissues%20and%20organs): First line of defense. This is an operation where they go into your bladder with a tool and destroy the abnormal tissue. Usually outpatient. Considered non-invasive. High rate of recurrence post operation.

[Cystectomy](https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/treatment/by-stage#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20stages%20II%20and,and%20surrounding%20tissues%20and%20organs): This is a radical surgery in which they just cut the bladder out. Its not uncommon. If the cancer shows signs of invading neighboring tissue or muscle, eg metastasizing, they dont fuck around. However, this surgery is harsh. [\~7% mortality rate flat out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137011/). Reduced quality of life. [A study showed that your 5-year survival rate post surgery is between 54.5%-68%.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3966145/#:~:text=Studies%20in%20Western%20countries%20have,patients%20who%20underwent%20radical%20cystectomy)

Chemotherapy: Previously described

[Radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/treatment/by-stage#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20stages%20II%20and,and%20surrounding%20tissues%20and%20organs): Targeted radiation works similarly to chemo in that it targets cells that divide rapidly. Harsh side effects as well.

[Immunotherapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8491352/): Our immune system does not like cancer. It would kill it if it could, but often it cant. Immunotherapy drugs can give our natural immune system the upper-hand. This is known as immunotherapy treatment. One of the best things about immunotherapy treatment: its kind of like teaching a person how to fish, as opposed to giving them a fish.[ It has been shown that your body becomes more naturally resistant to developing cancer in the future, post immunotherapy treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8491352/). Thats great, because cancer often returns (See TURBT). Chemo and radiation dont have this effect. They work when they are present, but when they are gone, your body is left wrecked, with an often **weakened** immune system (See Chemo/radiation kill cells that divide), and if the cancer comes back ([and it often does](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3773281/)), those treatments come back.

So lets discuss immunotherapy treatments. There are several drugs on the market that are currently used for immunotherapy treatment to fight bladder cancer, and other forms of cancer. The most commonly prescribed is Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, and ngl, [its fucking awesome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG_vaccine). Side note, it is our only vaccine against tuberculosis, dating back to 1921. Then, in the 1970s, it was discovered to be an effective treatment for bladder cancer. Originally approved in 1976 for immunotherapy, it was one of the first ever immunotherapy drugs to be utilized, and the first immunotherapy drug to be utilized for bladder cancer. However, it isnt perfect.[ ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944627/#:~:text=to%20prevent%20recurrences.-,Intravesical%20Bacillus%20Calmette%E2%80%93Guerin%20(BCG)%20has%20been%20the%20standard,develop%20recurrence%20of%20their%20cancer)For whatever reason, [\~30-40% of patients either don't respond to it or become resistant to it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944627/#:~:text=to%20prevent%20recurrences.-,Intravesical%20Bacillus%20Calmette%E2%80%93Guerin%20(BCG)%20has%20been%20the%20standard,develop%20recurrence%20of%20their%20cancer). [Some studies show an unresponsiveness as high as 70%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9527932/#:~:text=Most%20patients%20became%20BCG%2Dunresponsive,during%20their%20first%20treatment%20course). So it works great, unless it doesnt, and then you are one step closer to losing your bladder, and/or the prospect of chemotherapy/radiation on and off, hoping that the cancer doesnt return.

[There are other drugs at this point that are often used in tandem with, or independent of, BCG](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/i/immunotherapy-and-bladder-cancer). Those are: Durvalumab (AstraZeneca), Avelumab (Merck), Nivolumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and Pembrolizumab (AKA Keytruda) (Merck). The effectiveness for these drugs are often measured by two metrics: [PFS](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/pfs) (Progression free survival, eg how long the patient goes after treatment before the cancer resumes/returns), and their [ORR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046919/#:~:text=The%20tumor%20objective%20response%20rate%20(ORR)%20is%20the%20assessment%20of,end%2Dpoint%20in%20clinical%20trials) or [CR](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/complete-response). ORR means overall response rate, or the more impressive metric, CR which stands for complete remission or complete response. ORR/CR describe how many people basically respond to the drug positively, eg cancer shrinks (ORR) or disappears (CR). Here are the results from their own clinical trial papers:

[Durvalumab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9950974/) - Clinical trials done in tandem with radiation therapy. CR 54.5%, with 71.5% enjoying PFS after one year.

[Avelumab](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8882657/) - ORR varied depending on age group, but best performance 25%, with most people having PFS of 5.7 months

[Nivolumab](https://news.bms.com/news/details/2023/Opdivo-nivolumab-in-Combination-with-Cisplatin-Based-Chemotherapy-Followed-by-Opdivo-Demonstrates-Significant-Survival-Benefits-for-Cisplatin-Eligible-Patients-with-Unresectable-or-Metastatic-Urothelial-Carcinoma-in-Phase-3-CheckMate--901-Trial/default.aspx) - CR rate 21.7% versus 11.8% with chemo alone. A median 22 months PFS, or 52 months if your tumor expresses the PD-L1 protein.

[Pembrolizumab](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051177/) [and ](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/antitumor-activity-associated-with-pembrolizumab-in-bcg-unresponsive-papillary-nmibc)(aka Keytruda) - CR 41%, PFS 42% after 6 months.

[Enter ANKTIVA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684637/), which hasnt even been listed yet on the Urology Care Foundation, thats how new it is - CR 71% median CR duration 26.6 months. 96% of people who had complete remission, continue to have no disease after 24 months. This is when given in tandem with BCG.

ANKTIVA + BCG seems to be the clear winner in the immunotherapy contest for bladder cancer.

Did you see the names associated with those drugs? Lets take a closer look, $MRK for example, Market cap 324.89 billion. Annual sales revenue, [\~60.11B](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results/). How much of that is Keytruda (See Pembrolizumab above)? [Approximately 20B these are 2022 numbers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269401/revenues-of-keytruda/). That is a whole S of Mercks sales revenue. Now now, Keytruda has a long established use pipeline that is true. [It is also FDA approved for other forms of immunotherapy cancer treatment, not just bladder.](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/keytruda)

So, while ANKTIVA seems to be first in class for bladder cancer treatment, better than Keytruda even, Its too bad it cant treat other forms of cancer&. Right?&& Immunotherapy drugs are not necessarily cancer specific. Some work with various forms of cancer (see Keytruda). [Currently ANKTIVA is in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of:](https://immunitybio.com/pipeline/) Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Glioblastoma. [ANKTIVA is in Phase 1 clinical trials for](https://immunitybio.com/pipeline/): Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, annnnd HIV. Okay well, Phase 2 clinical trials for lung cancer, whatever. How do the results look like for that study? [They seems promising](https://immunitybio.com/non-small-cell-lung-cancer/), but results for ongoing clinical trials are typically not made public. I wish that I had all the answers, sorry. However, Immunity Bio has a web conference scheduled with the FDA in June to discuss the path to registration filing of ANKTIVA + other drugs as treatment for lung cancer. Given ANKTIVAs bladder cancer results, I would not be surprised if they move forward with registration.

Lets do some numbers. What did Immunity Bio bring in last year for sales revenue? [A whole 0.62 million](https://companiesmarketcap.com/immunitybio/revenue/). That's right ladies and gentleman, 620 thousand dollars. How much did Keytruda bring in for Merck again? Oh yeah,[ 20 fucking billion dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269401/revenues-of-keytruda/). How about the other drugs that ANKTIVA seems to best (at least in bladder cancer immunotherapy treatment).

Younger me didnt know much about investing and bought individual stocks which thankfully have yielded a considerable net positive.

As I learned about ETFs/index funds/bonds/etc. over the years my investing budget went toward those and I stopped retail investing altogether. I left the individual stocks alone because they were overall very profitable and most were companies that are big names and not super volatile.

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

I'm at the point now where I'd like to do long term value investing. To do that I'd like be able to understand the lingo, read financial statements, do at least basic analysis/valuation and make my own decisions.

I read multiple books on the subject at least partially. And my impression is that they don't introduce terms, don't explain the basics, don't really have an arch from simple to more complicated subjects and contain very little actionable instructions.

I got something out of all of them of course, but I feel like the information density is very sparse. There's a lof of repetition, stories and hystoric data, but most imoprtantly mentioning of interesting subjects without goin into those and thorough explanation. To learn some basics and do the little analysis I'm able to do these days I had to rely on googling stuff.

Surprisingly enough, less well known, cheap books I came across by accident prooved to be more useful. Like How to Keep Score in Business.

For starters, I'd like to read a book that clears up basic terms. What is equity or capital? What is earning, income, revenue or profit? What's the relationship between those? What is a share or stock? What is cash flow? And so on, from the beginning. In layman terms.

Then valuation. Starting from ratio vs percentage, (some books seem to use interchangably), basic math involved, where to get the data from and how to read it? What does split mean for the P/E? And so on... From simple things to more complicated. With studies if possible.

What I don't want is reading about just another famous investor turning a stock into a 3, 5, 10 bagger buy the wise decision of buying it. Or Bond vs stock comparison in the 3 to 5 years time frame with historic data from the 1920's in relation to the Dow using a 3% average annual inflation.

2024-05-10,1715364787.0,Real Estate vs. The Market - An answer to all those touting real estate as the way out there,"Real estate has often been touted as one of the most accessible ways to grow real wealth. Who among us ambitious havent heard the platitudinous claims passed off as conventional wisdom or perhaps as an arcane right of passage into occult upper echelons of society?

*Real estate makes more millionaires than any other industry.*

We have heard it in forums, self-help books, and from passing snake oil peddlers trying to get you to sign up for their educational seminar so you too can get rich.

As an engineer fortunate enough to not be living pay check to pay check as many Americans do, I also found this promise alluring. After all the basic principle that you can own a second home and collect a sizable and secure supplemental income certainly seems like a good deal at first approximation and so when me and my wife moved out of our first home for new jobs, we decided to keep it as a rental property rather than sell it.

We had purchased the property for only $130,000 dollars in 2017 and after living there for about five years the value had doubled. It was also located in an above average area of growth in South Carolina that had seen explosive growth going from Hicksville, USA to having two Starbucks by the time we moved out (of course the number of Starbucks is the proper measure of affluence). We were able to rent the house out with ease for two years for $1,800 a month while all of the recurring costs amounted to only $1,000 a month.

Indeed on paper it was an excellent investment. But when a difficult tenant started to stress us out we began to wonder if having a rental was worth all the hype in comparison to less stressful alternative investments.

So I decided that rather than scouring the internet for advice from likely unqualified faceless charlatans, I would conduct my own analysis of owning a rental home vs. simply investing in the stock market. After all, at one point in the not so distant past relying on your own mind rather than the top 10 Google search results to reach your own conclusions was considered desirable.

# The Calculation

My methodology was to calculate the total net benefit over the next 22 years (the time until the house would be paid off) in todays dollars of keeping the rental vs. the total net benefit in todays dollars of selling it and investing the proceeds in an index fund for 22 years and compare the two results. Although seemingly simple, the reality is that the financials of rentals are convoluted and comparing them to neat investments is *actually kind of difficult.* There are a lot of assumptions and extrapolations that must be made about both benefits and expenses.

The total net benefit for market investing was actually pretty simple. I estimated that the total proceeds from a sale after everything was said and done would be $100,000. So simply applied compounding interest to calculate the value Id have in 22 years.

For this I assumed the historical average market return of 10% (7% accounting for inflation) as well as a few other higher returns to see how I would fare if things went well.

Because I will not be retired in 22 years and this money would be growing in a traditional taxed brokerage account, I made the assumption that if I wanted to derive regular income from the final capital I would have to sell everything and take the fat 15% long-term capital gains tax in order to move the money from an index fund into a high yield fund providing a yield of 5%. I then further assumed that as income I would have to pay 29% of those earnings in federal and state taxes. This yielded the total income I could expect in my pocket every month after investing for 22 years.

Total derived benefit and possible income for investing $100,000 in index funds after 22 years.

The calculation for the house was much more tenuous, but as I mentioned earlier, you do have to make some big assumptions to make a comprehensive assessment of the total net benefit of renting a house for 22 years. I started by calculating the **total positive factors**:

**Total rent ** Assuming that I will increase rent at 3% to keep up with inflation, I assumed an average rent value for a total present day value of all collected rents over 22 years of $468,600. I then adjusted this value for an assumed vacancy rate of 8% to yield **$431,112 (A)**.

**Appreciation**  Of course one of the benefits of real estate is that it generally appreciates at a rate that is commensurate with the desirability of the location. Before things exploded circa 2022 and houses got crazy expensive, the rate of appreciation in my area was just under 5%. This is a good bit better than the historical national average of 3.5%. Since it is a higher growth area in South Carolina where Ill used the higher number. At 5% appreciation (2% after accounting for inflation) I can expect the house value to grow from the present value of $250,000 to about $386,494 or an increase of **$136,494 (B)** in todays dollars.

Although there are *many* other potential benefits of renting a house, at the basic level, the benefits are from rent and appreciation. So the total gross benefit can be calculated simply by adding **A+B** for a total of **$567,606.**

However, the story doesnt stop there. There are also negatives or *expenses* associated with owning a rental property. The **total negative factors** were calculated as:

**Capital gains tax on sale-** It turns out that when you sell your house after many years of appreciation you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the profit. *There actually are ways around this* but as we will discuss later they probably are pretty useless to the average one-off real estate investor. So since I paid $130,000 for the house and expect it to be worth $386,494 when I ultimately sell it 22 years from now, the net profit is $256,494 which is taxed at 15% costing **$38,474 (A)**.

**Depreciation recapture tax-** When you rent out a house you get to depreciate its value every year like any other large capital assett in a business. This means you can kind of say you lost a certain amount of value every year from use. That depreciation ultimately helps lower your taxes every year and so it is a benefit&.kind of.

When the time comes to sell your house, you actually have to pay the government back for all the asset depreciation you claimed. You could try to figure this out yourself, but I just used an online calculator and figured that I would have to pay about **$31,200 (B)** in depreciation recapture tax.

**Sales cost ** There are also significant costs associated with actually selling your house. Things like real estate agent commissions and repairs can really add up. Based on some internet research I saw that 8% is a reasonable number for sales cost. It could be more if there are many repairs needed. At 8% it would cost **$30,920 (C)** to sell a house for $386,494.

The total **future expenses at time of sale** can be calculated as **A+B+C** or $100,594. However, this is in 2046 dollars (22 years from 2024). This has to be adjusted to be in present 2024 dollars for the purpose of comparison. The adjusted number in 2024 dollars works out to **$58,432 (D)**.

**Maintenance ** There are also repairs to consider. Any repairs that are not covered by the rent payments come out of your pocket. There are a lot of assumptions that you have to make here. I was actually pretty light on repairs assuming that the tenant wouldnt trash the place and that only predictable things would need to get done. This included things like replacing the roof once, changing the carpet out three times in 22 years, and painting the place several times, and replacing the wooden privacy fence once. I also made the assumption that most of the repairs would be sooner rather than later. I browsed the internet to get estimated repair costs and life expectancy numbers. For 22 years I estimated **$75,000 (E)** (in todays dollars). Honestly, I think this number is very light and could easily see it being twice that.

So everything said and done, the total gross expense in present money can be found by adding **D** and **E** for a **total of $133,432.**

The **total net benefit** can *finally* be calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total benefits, or **$434,174** ($567,606  $133,432 )**.**

When we compare this with the estimated stock market returns, we see that it is on par with the 11% return (8% after inflation) which is slightly better than the more conservative 7% often quoted. So at that it looks like real estate wins! & however there is still more to consider.

# Other Considerations

Remember why I started looking at this in the first place? I said that having a rental property was beginning to stress me out. Even with a property management company running things the reality is that it is impossible for them to take care of your property the way you would want to. They arent there day in and day out noticing the slow degradation of condition. Yes, they will catch the big things and hopefully boot tenants that are trashing the place, but the insidious decay will be left un-noticed until it becomes a big enough problem.

For me, being emotionally attached to the house, I find this to be *incredibly stressful.* It is fair to say that not everyone feels that way about their properties, some are able to treat them strictly as business assets that require repair when they stop working. However, you really cant discount the psychological affects of dealing with someone who doesnt care about your home the way you do.

So now we are talking about 22 years of stress. That is 22 years of worrying if you are going to go in to sell the place and find that the house should be condemned and repairs would take a tremendous chunk out of what you expected (possible A LOT more than that $75k we estimated). That is 22 years of stress dealing with tenants and having to watch their ridiculous and rude maintenance tickets come through your email where they call you a slum lord and tell you that the carpet looks like someone took a shit on it (mind you *this* is who is living in the house you once loved).

*Is it still worth the difference?*

That is a personal determination that everyone in this situation must make on their own. In my case, I am leaning towards no.

*But why does everyone make a bid deal out of real estate? If the actual returns are comparable to the market, why is it so special?*

Now *that* is the question, and I think that we are ready to answer it given the context of the above analysis.

If the total net benefit really is comparable to the market then why in the hell would anyone want to dabble in real estate let alone claim it is *the way?*

I am hardly the Supreme Overlord Barron Lord Admiral of real estate investing, but I know enough to tell you that the reasons have to do with those secondary benefits we deferred from earlier.

The primary benefit of real estate is *leverage.* Leverage is the idea that you can own a house using primarily someone elses money (i.e., the banks through a mortgage). This means you get the full benefit of owning a house and renting it (full appreciation, equity, and rent proceeds) with minimal investment of your own. You are taking out a loan to buy an asset and having someone else pay for it. Leverage is possible for stock investing, but houses are much more secure investments and banks realize this and so the rates and terms are much more reasonable than taking out a loan to buy stocks. So why would you ever want to give that up?

The reality is that you are only leveraged while you are &. well, leveraged. As your equity in the house increases (either by paying down the mortgage or through appreciation) you become less leveraged. That is to say that magical benefit of real estate decreases with the less you owe.

Look at it this way. Say you only owe the bank one more dollar on your mortgage; while you still dont own the house outright, you have nearly 100% equity. That equity is effectively *your money* (not the banks) that can be applied to anything and thus it carries an opportunity cost. That is, you have to compare what it is doing for you tied up in the house to what you could get from the market or other investments. If the situation were flipped and you only had one dollar of equity, it is a **much** better deal& you couldnt do much else with that single dollar. *The more equity you have in your house, the less leveraged it is, and the more it acts like a traditional stock.*

What youll find, is that houses perform very much like high dividend, low growth stocks. That is, they provide good income, but appreciate less than the market. When we do the comparison (as we did above) it really does come out as more of a wash than many burgeoning real estate investors might think.

There are other benefits to owning a home. For example, it is real and has an intrinsic value; when the next great depression happens, people will still need a place to live. Plus, since mortgages dont change with time (that is they get cheaper with time due to inflation) *you* could live there during difficult times, probably for much less than your current rent or mortgage.

Although these are secondary considerations, there are also creative financial mechanisms available for homes. For example, home equity loans or lines of credit can give you a better rate when you need money compared to a private loan. There are also mechanisms to avoid having to pay taxes on your gains (possibly until you die) such as 1031 exchanges, however these are very complicated and are really only designed for real estate investors to turn one property into another. They are nearly useless for the average Joe with maybe one rental (big surprise).

We also hear a lot about the tax benefits of owning rental property. What are those? Well you can claim depreciation. Depreciation is the governments way of acknowledging that large capital business assets (think a large factory machine) lose value over time as they are used. So you are generally allowed to claim back the full purchase price of your home over the course of 30 years which helps to offset taxes on the rental income. However, you *do have to pay it all back* when you sell the house in a process called depreciation recapture tax. So maybe it isnt that much of a benefit after all&.the real benefit is that since you pay it back later it is worth less due to inflation. Not a huge benefit& You can also claim business operating expenses to also help offset your rental income (think new roof, new windows, repairs, project management fees etc.).

So now seeing the whole picture it is obvious that there are *some* benefits to owning a rental home over investing in the stock market. However, they may not be what you thought. Lets recap:

* **The total net benefit from renting a house, vs. investing in the market is likely comparable.**
* **Renting a house is much more stressful (even with a management company) than investing in the stock market. You have to have the right kind of personality to not be affected by people trashing your place, being rude to you, and, if this was a home you lived in, the steady decay of a home you once loved (because no, management companies do not maintain houses like you did when you lived there). There is also (id argue) a lot more variability in how youll fare with real estate (assumptions about vacancy rate, long-term repairs, etc.)**
* **The primary benefit of owning rentals is the ability to leverage into a stable investment on favorable terms. The more of your house you own, the more they perform like traditional stocks and the less argument there is for keeping it due to the opportunity cost of your tied up equity.**
* **There are some secondary benefits, pertaining to taxes, the actual utility of the home, and some creative financing opportunities.**

**So in conclusion:** what does this mean? It means in an apple to apple comparison houses are good investments that rival stock markets but they are much more stressful. However, with leverage being the primary benefit *there is* a real advantage here if you are willing to maximize your leverage in the real estate market.

If you are going to have one house and pay it off and keep it for income, Id advise you to consider other options if it is stressing you out as (1) it wont make you rich and (2) it may not be better than the markets. **However,** if you are going to go big and leverage leverage (no not a typo) there is a possibility to do well.

So what does that mean? Money is made in real estate at the front end by making good investments and using (and I mean USING leverage). If you are willing to maximize your credit and home equity usage as much as possible to buy more and more houses putting as little of your own money into each one as possible and you are willing to have a part or full-time job dealing with managing them all and it wont stress you out, it is **a** path to wealth.

2024-08-05,1722859834.0,Global Asset Bust | Yen Carry Trade Unwind Explainer,"# Background

A yen carry trade is a popular currency trading strategy that involves borrowing money in Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing it in assets or currencies with higher yields. Here are the key aspects of a yen carry trade:

1. Mechanism: Investors borrow yen at Japan's low interest rates and convert it to another currency, typically investing in higher-yielding assets like stocks, bonds, or currencies of countries with higher interest rates.
2. Popularity: The yen has been a favored currency for carry trades because Japan has maintained near-zero interest rates for over two decades to combat deflation.
3. Profitability: The strategy aims to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the target investment country. For example, borrowing at 0.5% in Japan and investing at 4% in the US could yield a 3.5% profit (before accounting for exchange rate fluctuations).
4. Risk: The main risk is exchange rate fluctuations. If the yen strengthens against the investment currency, it can erode or eliminate profits and potentially lead to losses.
5. Market impact: Large-scale yen carry trades can influence global financial markets. When the yen strengthens significantly, investors may rush to unwind their positions, potentially causing volatility in various asset classes, including equities.
6. Historical context: Yen carry trades have been partly blamed for contributing to market instability, such as during the 2008 financial crisis.
7. Current relevance: Recent strengthening of the yen and changes in Bank of Japan policy have led to speculation about the unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially affecting global markets, including US equities.

It's important to note that while yen carry trades can be profitable, they also carry significant risks and can have far-reaching effects on global financial markets.

# Relationship with Big Tech Stocks

The yen carry trade is a sophisticated financial strategy that involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets. This approach has gained popularity due to Japan's long-standing policy of maintaining near-zero interest rates to combat deflation. One common application of this strategy is selling yen to buy U.S. big tech stocks. 

To initiate a yen carry trade, a trader first borrows yen from a Japanese bank. Japan's low interest rates make borrowing yen an attractive option for investors seeking to leverage their investments. Once the yen is borrowed, the next step is to convert it into U.S. dollars. This can be accomplished through a currency exchange service or a forex trading platform. For instance, if a trader borrows 10 million yen at an interest rate of 0.1%, and the current exchange rate is 1 USD = 110 JPY, the trader would exchange the 10 million yen for approximately $90,909.With the U.S. dollars in hand, the trader then invests in U.S. big tech stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft, or Google. These companies are often chosen because they are expected to yield higher returns compared to the cost of borrowing the yen. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States, as well as the potential appreciation of the tech stocks. However, this strategy is not without risks. 

One significant risk is exchange rate fluctuation. If the yen appreciates against the dollar, the trader may incur losses when converting the dollars back to yen to repay the loan. Additionally, there is market risk, as the value of the U.S. tech stocks may decline, leading to potential investment losses. Furthermore, changes in interest rates in Japan or the U.S. can impact the profitability of the carry trade. For example, if U.S. interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing yen may become less attractive, reducing the potential gains from the investment.Recent market conditions have added another layer of complexity to the yen carry trade. The yen has been strengthening, and there are growing concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. This has led to a mass deleveraging, where investors sell assets, including U.S. tech stocks, to cover their losses and repay yen-denominated loans.

# Bank of Japan Raised Interest Rate to the 0.25 on July 31, 2024

[https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/bank-japan-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-2024-07-30/)

# The Yen Carry Trade Unwind

The Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates to 0.25% has triggered a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy that has long influenced global financial markets.  This policy made the yen an attractive currency for carry trades, where investors borrow yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets abroad, often including U.S. big tech stocks. The profitability of this strategy relies on the interest rate differential between Japan and other countries, as well as the relative stability of exchange rates.

The Bank of Japan's move to raise interest rates, although still low by global standards, signals a shift towards normalizing monetary policy. This change has profound implications for the yen carry trade. As the interest rate differential narrows, the profitability of the carry trade diminishes, prompting investors to unwind their positions.The unwinding process typically involves selling the assets purchased with borrowed yen and converting the proceeds back to yen to repay the loans. In the context of U.S. big tech stocks, which have been a favored destination for carry trade investments, this means large-scale selling of these equities. 

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, home to many of these big tech stocks, often experiences heightened volatility during such periods.The impact of this unwinding extends beyond just the stock market. As investors rush to close their positions, demand for yen increases, causing the currency to appreciate. This appreciation further accelerates the unwinding process, as it makes the carry trade even less profitable and potentially leads to losses for those who don't exit their positions quickly enough.The ripple effects of this unwinding can be felt across global financial markets. As large volumes of U.S. tech stocks are sold, it can lead to broader market selloffs. 

# Forced Selling

The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 0.25% has led to a significant unwinding of the yen carry trade, a strategy where investors borrow yen at low-interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets. This unwinding is driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and substantial price drawdowns in the assets being sold off, particularly U.S. big tech stocks.

.The yen carry trade relies on the stability or depreciation of the yen and low-interest rates in Japan. Investors borrow yen at minimal costs, convert it to U.S. dollars, and invest in assets like U.S. big tech stocks, which offer higher returns. However, the recent appreciation of the yen and the narrowing interest rate differential between Japan and the U.S. have made this strategy less profitable. As the yen strengthens, the cost of repaying yen-denominated loans increases, eroding the gains from investments in higher-yielding assets .The depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar has exacerbated the situation.

 When the yen appreciates, investors who borrowed in yen face higher costs when converting their returns back to yen to repay their loans. This scenario forces investors to unwind their positions to avoid mounting losses. The process of unwinding involves selling off the assets purchased with borrowed yen, such as U.S. big tech stocks, and converting the proceeds back to yen. This forced selling creates downward pressure on the prices of these assets, leading to significant price drawdowns.The large price drawdowns in U.S. big tech stocks are a direct consequence of this forced selling. As investors rush to liquidate their positions, the increased supply of stocks on the market drives prices down. This selloff is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying fundamentals of these companies but rather a reaction to the changing dynamics of the yen carry trade. 

The sharp declines in stock prices can trigger further selling as investors seek to cut their losses, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of declining asset prices and rising yen value. The broader implications of the yen carry trade unwinding are significant. The forced selling of U.S. big tech stocks can lead to increased volatility in global financial markets. As these stocks are widely held and influential in major indices, their price movements can impact market sentiment and investor behavior across various asset classes. Additionally, the appreciation of the yen can have ripple effects on other currencies and markets, as investors adjust their positions in response to the changing exchange rate environment.

# TLDR;

The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike to 0.25% has triggered a substantial unwinding of the yen carry trade, driven by the depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and significant price drawdowns in the assets being sold off. This forced selling has led to increased volatility in U.S. big tech stocks and broader financial markets, highlighting the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the far-reaching consequences of changes in monetary policy.",wallstreetbets,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ekm6al/global_asset_bust_yen_carry_trade_unwind_explainer/,Other,POSITIVE,0.5843065977096558

I rejected this advice, and convinced my girlfriend to come with me. Four days after we arrived, the world was locked down and all the hotels in the country were closed.

2024-08-08,1723144390.0,NVDA will beat earnings again this month!,"Just to be clear this is not financial advice, and there are more factors than an earnings beat that affect stock price, but this is why I think NVDA will beat revenue predictions of $28B on Aug 28th 2024.

This article https://observer.com/2024/06/nvidia-largest-ai-chip-customers/ lists MSFT and META as the 2 biggest customers of NVDA chips last year (they spent $9B in 2023). Their total capex for 2023 is $55.3B combined. Which means that they spent 16.2% of their total Capex spending in 2023 on NVDA chips alone. So I looked at their Capex for this last quarter, which is $22.04B combined, up from $15.17B combined in Q2 2023 (up 45% YoY). The article also states that these 2 along with AMZN, and GOOGL make up a little less than 40% of all NVDA chip sales in 2023. So, I looked at their numbers as well. AMZN and GOOGL in Q2-2024 spent $30.80B on Capex, up from $18.33B in Q2 2023 (up 68% YoY). If we use the 16.2% of their capex rule on NVDA from 2023 then combined the 4 companies spent $8.56B in Q2 alone this quarter on NVDA chips.

(Position at the end)

List of motivations:

1. I think INTC right now is pretty undervalued. They have issues, of course, but they have a lot of potential in fields that are growing rapidly where VCs and investors are putting money, like AI.
2. **Gaudi 3**: This chip is very promising, and if they can keep developing AI chips like that, they will sell like hotcakes. The software is not already there like CUDA but it's getting closer.
3. **Next-gen CPUs**: The current 13th and 14th gen are bad, really bad, but they are integrating AI accelerators (Intel® Core"" Ultra). That is the same move NVIDIA made with their RTX series. I think this is one step ahead of the competition and will pay off in the future when applications that require AI, like Photoshop, use these new accelerators instead of the cloud with simpler versions of their models. Similar to Google and Pixel phones.
4. [US Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html): As the announcement said, Intel and other critical chip manufacturers are getting a lot of support from the US administration, and this will continue with Trump's ""Made in USA"" plans.

2024-08-14,1723634469.0,The Perfect Storm: Be cautious before going fully back into bull mode,"Disclaimer: I am not yet lifetime profitable.

Thesis: I think this short term bounce might potentially very quickly run headfirst into a wall and come crashing down hard. Maybe even already today.

We are fast approaching the 50 SMA as well as a more notable resistance. Additionally at almost the same spot we are running into a short term downwards sloping trendline as well as a longterm upwards sloping trendline (the purple X). Also, volume has been extremely extremely extremely light since Friday. Add to this that today CPI is coming out and that for a while now this pullback has been extremely volatile, in both directions, and usually such huge moves in such a short time dont last very long and always beget a quick counter reaction. All these things are also happening near the symbolic 5500 level.

I think the market is just looking for an excuse to go lower and will price in CPI negatively more likely than not. 

Now we may very well just continue to go higher, but even then I do not think there is much breathing room to the upside left. in 2023 there was a similar, less volatile pullback that lasted from 1st August to 1st November, while also having bounces inbetween, but always resulting in a lower high. There were similar pullbacks during earlier years.

The sentiment I gather from the various stock subreddits seems very bullish, but considering the above and the fact that we cannot be sure until we have actually surpassed the previous ATH, I would be very cautious to go back into bull mode. I, for one, am looking for a short opportunity here, either when its already going down hard or when we approach the 5500 level.

Q: (from u/LittleWhite0nRice)
You seem really knowledgeable on this industry. I've done a lot of DD on them and they seem great. But my question is: what's their future outlook for expansion? It seems like most space exploration companies are private and won't use LUNR so their consumer is NASA which can be defunded easily. Why keep spending money going to the moon? 

A:
Lander missions and rover are the short term. Lunar satellites are the long term. Providing *the* communications network for lunar truckstop to Mars is a pretty sci fi concept but thats how they'd go from 1-off missions and a market cap of $500M to something in the double digit $B. This plan is already in action- ""The [IM3] mission is also scheduled to carry a data relay satellite, Khon2, which it will deploy to travel to the L2 Earth-Moon libration point. The mission can also carry approximately 1000 kg of secondary payloads to lunar transfer orbit."" This is currently scheduled for Oct 25.

Positions- Shares, 2, 5, and 10 dollar calls spread between Jan '24 into 2025.

TLDR: LUNR is legit. WSB effect could create a squeeze, but I am in long term.

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.

Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.

They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)

They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.

They drive a TSLA or RIVN.

They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.

They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"".

They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.

They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.

To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.

They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.

They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.

When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.

When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.

After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.

They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

Whatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.

At the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.

And of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",wallstreetbets,71.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ey5xy1/the_millenial_40_milf_list/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9969088435173035

2024-08-03,1722718509.0,The Bulls Are Delusional,"The bulls are delusional. The fundamental reason why the market has been mostly going straight up in the past year is because the economy, in aggregate, has been doing very well. Data just came out suggesting that this might be coming to an end. This is not just a fart in the wind or a drop because Powell said something with the wrong tone of voice. It's a fundamental catalyst that will actually impact things. If the data is wrong, then sure, we might go up more. However, people that actually manage money will not ignore deteriorating economic data. They will sell stocks in order to try to time the market. If you're dollar cost averaging, then good for you, but the majority of people here (and on wallstreet) are trying to time the markets to speed up the process of making money. And you don't make money by buying a 5% dip after a 40% rally if you believe that a recession might be coming. 

People have been leveraging like crazy and are going through the 5 stages of grief now that the market went against them. Every time that someone complains that they are down on Nvidia, the most upvoted comment under it is ""don't worry bro, just hold because it will be at $180 in 6 months"". Anecdotally, it seems like everyone's uncle and inheritor of money is all-in on AI. For it to go even higher, someone has to be buying at higher prices. It also has to start making some serious money for the companies who are spending tens of billion of dollars on it. So far, Microsoft and Google are struggling to monetize it relative to the expectations that were being priced in. 

We haven't had a recession since 2008. Covid doesn't count. The fed raised rates and the economy didn't give two shits. If the fed lowers rates, why is the economy magically expected to get better immediately? These are serious concerns and if you think buying the ""dip"" right now is a no-brainer move, then you have no brain. We were at all-time highs 3 weeks ago and deteriorating economic data doesn't flip overnight. Neither do the concerns about it. These last couple of weeks have laid out very important information about what the market as a whole cares about and will rally or crash because of. Lots of people seem to be ignoring this and sticking their head in the sand. Good luck.

Edit: From the hundred or so comments that disagree with me, here's a summary of the sentiment. People think that a deteriorating economy is bullish because the fed will cut rates faster. They think the fed and government will pump money into the economy to keep it going and that's bullish. While I don't disagree with that, I also think that this is a poor argument to buy the dip at nearly an all-time high, especially if you're hoping for quick profits. Stocks will eventually go up simply because the value of the dollar will continue to get inflated away, but you can spend years holding the bag and being in the red. People will try to avoid this and sell their stocks to buy at a lower price later on. If a recession actually occurs, there will be lots of selling soon. Also, I'm not necessarily predicting a recession, I'm making a simple observation of the data and how the market has been reacting to it. For a while, the market has been ignoring bad data and rallying on rate-cut optimism. It is now doing the opposite. This is a very important observation if you want to make predictions.

Edit 2: I've read every comment on this post and it's pretty clear that there is a substantial fear of missing out on the next rally. A lot of people are horrified at the idea of sitting out of the market for a while, let alone going short. This makes me more certain that we've topped out for now and that the upside risk is low.

-Stanley Druckenmiller cut his NVDA stake

-Brad Gerstner a top advocate for AI today on cnbc mention his fund has a few short positions and trimmed some stakes in AI holdings.

-NVDA insiders have been consistently selling over the last year. All insiders at AI companies have been for that matter.

-SMCI didn't pre release earnings as they did before.

-NVDA delivery delays are shrinking.

-MCHP earnings were in line, didnt blow past expectations.

-INTC bombed on earnings

-AMD didnt blow past expectations

-ARM releases earnings this week, will see what their order flow looks like.

-ASML orders took a dive.

-Buffet sold some Apple, doenst seem to be phased by their AI initiatives.

-Even Meta mentioned their new goal is AI metaverse software development. Seems they got all the chips they need. They also lowered guidance going forward.

-These earnings are crucial for NVDA, this could determine the next steps for the AI cycle.

-Theres also growing competition in chip developments, seems every company(Apple, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc) are making their own chips for custom use.

I just dont think there is an issue getting chip anymore. The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow. The 1 year honeymoon period may be over, AI spending needs to start adding to earnings. otherwise its a massive expense for alot of companies of buying the chips and spending a lot of money on electricity to run the machines.

2023-11-01,1698863463.0,The Arbitrage case for Spirit Airlines,"Related Position Disclosure: I own 14,054 shares of SAVE.

Important Disclaimer:  Nothing in this post is, or should be construed as investment advice.  I describe my reasoning for why I did what I did.  That doesn't mean it is a good idea for you.  You can do your own research, consult a trusted financial advisor, or do whatever it is you think makes the most investing sense.  What you shouldn't do is blindly follow me.  I am not a financial advisor.  I am an amateur investor, and any positive past performance I have enjoyed is not a guarantee of future success.  All investments carry the risk of loss.  This post discusses a particularly risky investment, which will probably not fit with the risk tolerance and goals of all investors.

Per the above disclosure, I am significantly invested in Spirit Airlines.  This investment is recent.  I am not posting because I want to pump up my stock.  Rather, I recently acquired this position because of the reasoning contained herein.

Background:  

Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has a deal inked to be acquired by JetBlue, which if it goes through, will result in spirit being acquired with a final payment to shareholders of $31/share.  There are periodic monthly payments to spirit shareholders in the amount of $0.10.  The deal is detailed and there are other provisions I don't mention here.  You can, and probably should look into those yourself if you have any exposure to the deal.  Financing for the deal has been secured.  The DoJ has sued to block the merger, with the case currently going on in the U.S. District Court in Boston. 

Downside and Upside potential:

At the time of writing, SAVE is trading at $11.34/share.  That is 173% upside if the deal goes through, without counting the $0.10/share monthly payments.  Spirit is experiencing severe difficulties as a company, due both to diminished demand and due to problems with aircraft engines which will keep numerous planes grounded over the next couple years.  While there is a likelihood of a financial recovery related to delayed delivery of aircraft and defective engines, it is difficult to come to a figure for the fair value of spirit sans-merger.  My own personal estimate is that on deal failure, SAVE would likely trade at around $5 per share, which would be a 56% loss on deal failure.

Lawsuit outlook:

I view the outlook as moderately favoring the deal being approved.  JetBlue is the 6th largest airline in the US, and Spirit is the 7th.  The acquisition would result in JetBlue being the 5th largest airline, with a market share of about 10%, in an industry that is dominated by the big 4 airlines.  That is the single strongest argument for the merger.  It is hard to see how this substantially lessens competition.  There are more issues, however, when you get deep into the weeds.  

There are some routes where Spirit and JetBlue could, in combination, have a dominant market share.  The DoJ proposes that these be viewed as individual markets.  JetBlue has made agreements for some divestitures of gates and routes to other Ultra Low Cost Carriers to endeavor to remedy these concerns, which DoJ believes are insufficient.

Spirit is the biggest Ultra Low Cost Carrier, and its absorption by JetBlue would mean the removal of seats from its planes and an increase in ticket costs, which the DoJ will argue will be a harm to consumers.  JetBlue would argue that the increased amenities  on JetBlue are a positive for consumers and that the merger will allow it to compete better with the big 4 airlines, creating a net positive for consumers.

It seems to me that the case against the deal was much stronger before the end of the Northeast Alliance, which involved a high degree of cooperation and coordination between JetBlue and American Airlines.  Additionally, the financial difficulties of Spirit make it difficult to see the company surviving on its own without substantially increasing fares, which cuts against the DoJ case.  In an industry dominated by American, Southwest, Delta, and United, it is hard to see the potential of a 5th strong competitor emerging as a problem for competition.

There remains some possibility that the DoJ and JetBlue will reach some kind of settlement that allows the deal to go through, producing a windfall for shareholders, but the odds of that happening diminish every day.

Other known risks:

There is a non-zero risk that JetBlue could endeavor to back out of the deal by arguing that Spirit has suffered a ""Material Adverse Event"", in that its business has substantially diminished since the deal was struck.  I view this risk as remote, given that an MAE is an incredibly difficult threshold under Delaware law, and because contract provisions specifically exclude industry-wide events from that definition, and because the aircraft engine issue does affect other airlines, even if not to the same extent that it affects Spirit, and also because the likelihood of financial compensation for this problem from the airplane manufacturer mitigates much of the potential harm in the long term.

   There is some possibility that JetBlue could endeavor to reprice the deal lower, using the argument of a Material Adverse Event. It seems moderately likely to me that Spirit would accept a slight discount rather than litigate this issue, but a severe discount appears highly improbable, as Spirit would likely prevail in court if JetBlue were to endeavor to back out, financing is already secured, and the contract does provide the remedy of Specific performance.

Summary:

I view the odds of this deal being successfully completed at somewhere around 70%.  That is no guarantee and of course reasonable minds may differ.  The U.S. Government has recently been on a track of challenging mergers that would traditionally be approved, and this has caused them to lose some big cases (see the Microsoft-Activision or Meta-Within as examples).  A few years ago, an antitrust challenge by the government was usually the death knell of a merger, but that is no longer the case.

If my proposition that this deal is 70% likely to be successful is correct, looking at a timeline resulting in payment early 2024, the risk/reward proposition looks favorable to me.  That doesn't mean I'm right.  It is just what I think.

Note:  In the interest of writing a post, rather than writing a book, I've only included what I view as the most important information.  There is a lot of other information.  You might find the information I didn't include is more important to you than the information I did include.  Please do your own research, and get advice from trusted financial advisors.  I find this interesting, but I'd like to reiterate that my thoughts and musings are not and should not be considered investment advice.

Wait a minute, there is another strange thing in the tables above. In the latest results, #NVIDIA declares:

* 18.8bn$ of future inventory commitments
* 10.6bn$ of future non-inventory commitments
* TOTAL 29.4bn$

This means that #NVIDIA increased the orders with its suppliers to produce GPUs only by 16.7% while total future commitments increased by 42%. What about inventory orders compared to one year ago? They grew from 7.24bn$ to 18.8bn$ or TWO-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE PERCENT

Wait a minute, by how much did #NVIDIAs Computer and Networking revenues grow over the past year? 404%&

Basically, #NVIDIA pretends us to believe that:

* Its clients purchase in big sizes never asking for a discount (and do not forget \~50% of the total revenues come from just 4 names: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta)
* Its suppliers continue producing at the same costs over the years despite the boom in order

So clearly the laws of demand and supply do not apply to #NVIDIA unless& the company keeps rebates to clients and production costs increases by its suppliers off-the-book to keep showcasing unrealistic margins in the same way they did, and got fined for, in the aftermath of the dotcom bust: [NVIDIA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/is-nvda-currently-employing-the-same-accounting-trick-to-inflate-its-margins-it-was-previously-caught-using-during-the-dot-com-bubble/)

As if the above I described was not already enough, we already know:

* NVIDIA is inflating its sales via client financing. In some very peculiar situations, Nvidia is even a significant shareholder of them, like in the case of Coreweave: [NVIDIA (PONZI) LIES UNDER NVIDIA NOSE](https://justdario.com/2023/11/nvda-ponzi-lies-under-nvda-nose/)
* NVIDIA is gamma-squeezing its own stock: [NVIDIA  THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/nvidia-the-fraud-smoking-gun/)

At this point, I believe there is no more doubt that #NVIDIA is only one piece of a bigger fraudulent puzzle.

1- #NVIDIA invests in [#Coreweave](https://justdario.com/tag/coreweave/)

2- #Coreweave buys (overpriced) #NVIDIA GPUs.

3- #Coreweave raises financing using #NVIDIA GPUs as collateral. What do they do with that? They buy more #NVIDIA GPUs, of course&

4- Meanwhile #Microsoft signs a deal with #Coreweave worth billions for future use of a cloud infrastructure #Coreweave didnt even begin to build yet while #Microsoft is, at the same time, loading on #NVIDIA GPUs for Azure that technically is a #Coreweave competitor?!

2023-11-17,1700253915.0,The Verge - Sam Altman fired as CEO of OpenAI,"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired

* Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday. 

* Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is leaving after a deliberative review process by the companys board.

* Altman has largely been the face of OpenAI

Mr. Altmans departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities, the company said in its blog post. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.


Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO. The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didnt immediately return The Verges call for comment. 

This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the companys DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last years hugely-popular ChatGPT.

Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers, according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.

Altman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apples former chief design officer, about making the iPhone of artificial intelligence, though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. Hes also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.

Altman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla. 

OpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company.",stocks,322.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17xolry/the_verge_sam_altman_fired_as_ceo_of_openai/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9996955394744873

(Up until today its all been in managed accounts.  This was an impulse buy driven by my personal interest (AI), so I hope this wasn't too irrational of a purchase.

----

UPDATE: Since I'm getting some salty and sarcastic comments, I'll explain my thinking, although it'll likely attract more saltiness:

I'm gambling Microsoft will become the leader in AI given what's happened in the last 24 hours. OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).

 MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.

AI is the ""next big thing"", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.

People are commenting, ""but it's at ATH"", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.

And all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.  I was hoping this would be a friendly community.

Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altmans four days in exile, several staff researchers sent the board of directors a letter warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a catalyst that caused the board to oust Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board that led to Altmans firing. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The researchers who wrote the letter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OpenAI declined to comment.

According to one of the sources, long-time executive Mira Murati mentioned the project, called Q*, to employees on Wednesday and said that a letter was sent to the board prior to this weekends events.

After the story was published, an OpenAI spokesperson said Murati told employees what the media reports were about but she did not comment on the accuracy of the information.

The maker of ChatGPT had made progress on Q* (pronounced Q-Star), which some internally believe could be a breakthrough in the startups search for superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as AI systems that are smarter than humans.

Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*s future success, the source said.

If data comes out from other regions other than China showing the same significant meaningful outcomes of this drug then there could be a pretty big fireworks show. This drug has the potential to rival and beat Keytruda which was the highest performing drug of 2023.

2024-07-29,1722265868.0,HIMS DD - A generational buy and this earning won't be too late because it isn't priced in,"# Introduction

HIMS is a stock that had gotten some steam recently with it's over 100% run this year, but has cooled down after trading in its $20-24 dollar range for a few weeks. I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying ""it's all ready priced in"", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.

# Numbers

Lets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \~100k subscribers a quarter.



However, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide ""new year new me"" or ""new years resolutions"" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.

Source: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)

I say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\~100k subs quarter.**

|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|
|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|
|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|

In Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!

I'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.

""The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.

The data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.""

Using the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their ""best"" quarter Q1.

Signs are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.

|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Q4 2022|126,000|167|
|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|
|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|
|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|
|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|
|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|

What got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \~20 million.**

Why is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.

You see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.

In other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.

**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**

**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**

This is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:

(""BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue."") - **wrong Bozo**

lets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).

I say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**

So what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.

Also, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.

So here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:

Low estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.

150k subs \* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**

High estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.

190k subs \* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \* $100 other products + 10k \*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**

**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.

TLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.

Part 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.

2024-07-31,1722416876.0,"Are NVIDIA's AI chips still ""so good that even when the competitors chips are free, its not cheap enough,"" as Jensen Huang said in March? ","TL;DR: Probably yes (just my opinion)...

On Monday, July 29, Apple Research [published the scientific background of its ""Apple Foundation Model""](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/apple-intelligence-foundation-language-models) (AFP). According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...

According to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\*).

One of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\*).

According to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be ""so good"". And I haven't done this calculation for the upcoming Blackwell generation...

2024-08-01,1722523660.0,Intel (INTC) Bear thesis for Earnings,"Intel has had a rough month.  If you browse the r/pcmasterrace you will see numerous threads about how Intel's most recent line of chips frequently throw errors and cause numerous problems in applications.  This issue has also received decent attention in the press and it effects their entire line of most recent chips, including the commercial sector and server consumers; this issue is not limited to retail consumers.  Intel's response to these reports has been a bit schizo; first denying the problem exists, then claiming they found the issue and had a fix lined up, then announcing there was no possible fix and most recently denying that there would be a recall despite the faults in their product.  This behavior has had a negative impact on consumer sentiment for the company.

  
Recently in the news Intel has announced mass layoffs, there is even a recent thread about his in WSB; this is not a good look as a company enters earnings.  If Earnings were good we wouldn't expect an announcement of mass layoffs, it is another bearish indicator as Intel enters earnings after market closes today.

  
Looking a little deeper into the most recent earnings report and comparing them with google's stock graph over the year, you can see that with the last two earnings reports INTC dropped immediately following earnings.  The last earnings report drop is the most interesting to me since even though Intel reported a slight beat in earnings, the stock dropped over 10% the next day.  I believe the earnings report coming tonight will be very bad for Intel and we will see a similar drop in stock price to what occurred the previous 2 earnings as past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.

  
Counterthesis:  I'm not overly confident in this play.  INTC has dropped around 4% over the last week.  It's possible that investors have already ""priced in"" the expected bad numbers into the upcoming earnings; if so while the earnings report will definitely be bad regardless, they may beat the expected terrible earnings with mere bad numbers and the stock may stay flat or even rise slightly; this is especially true since investors are aware of mass layoffs which will reduce expected costs for the upcoming quarter.

  
Taken as a whole I expect a drop following Intels reported earnings and have bought puts on INTC expiring 2Aug 2024 as a result:

1. Premium partnerships: Coursera's got the Ivy League and Big Tech backing them. We're talking Google, Stanford, IBM, Imperial College London. Udemy? It's the wild west - anyone can upload a course.

2. Degree programs: Coursera offers legit bachelor's and master's degrees from real universities. Try getting a degree from Udemy (spoiler: you can't).

3. Enterprise focus: Coursera's got 1,511 paid enterprise customers, including Fortune 500 companies and governments. They're not just selling to broke college students.

4. AI innovation: Coursera's going all-in on AI. They've got 2 million enrollments in AI courses, AI-powered features like Coursera Coach, and are pumping out new AI content with top partners.

5. Academic credibility: Coursera's the first online learning platform to get the American Council on Education's seal of approval. That means their stuff can count for real college credit.

6. Revenue model: Coursera's got a diversified revenue stream - Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees. Udemy's mostly relying on individual course sales.

7. Growth trajectory: Coursera's showing solid growth across all segments. Udemy? Not so much.

Don't get me wrong, Udemy has its place. But if you're betting on the future of education, Coursera's playing in a whole different league. It's like comparing a bootleg DVD to Netflix. 

Tldr; Coursera = big brain. Udemy = smooth brain.

Listen up, smooth brains. While you've been YOLOing on meme stocks, a real opportunity has been brewing. I'm talking about Coursera (COUR). Yeah, the online education company. Boring, right? WRONG. This thing is a sleeping giant about to wake up. Here's why:

1. Crushing the numbers: Q2 revenue up 11% YoY to $170.3M. Consumer revenue up 12%, Enterprise up 8%, Degrees up 14%. They're growing across all segments.
2. AI hype train: Over 2 MILLION enrollments in their generative AI courses. Everyone and their mother wants to learn AI right now.
3. Big name partnerships: Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft all launching new certificates on Coursera. These are the heavy hitters.
4. International expansion: Added 7M new registered learners in Q2, now at 155M total. Huge global TAM.
5. Improving margins: Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4M (6.1% margin) vs -$2.9M (-1.9%) last year. They're scaling efficiently.
6. Strong balance sheet: $709M cash, no debt. Plenty of ammo for growth.
7. Undervalued: Trading at \~2.5x forward revenue. Compare that to other high-growth SaaS companies trading at 10x+.

The market is sleeping on this, but it won't last. As the AI hype continues and more people look to upskill, Coursera is positioned perfectly. Analysts have price targets up to $30. We could easily see 100%+ upside from here.

This isn't financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD. But in my smooth-brained opinion, COUR is ready for launch ===

2024-08-25,1724607819.0,"The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings","## Why is AI a bubble?

Before any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.

The business case for AI is dead simple: ""Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?"". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like ""just make it work"" and ""do more with less"". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 ""just make it work"" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.

It's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying ""FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green"" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.

And GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.

## Why now?

A ground rule for machine learning is ""exponential investment for linear gains"". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.

* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of ""all words ever written by humans"".
* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).
* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).
* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.

But most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of ""the next version will finally be it, trust me bro"" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.

## Why Nvidia?

Nvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.

The expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.

Nvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.

## Are we in for a broader tech crash?

Personally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.

The real hit in the medium term will be to ""shovel sellers"". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.

2024-08-27,1724769370.0,Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters,"* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.
* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. 
* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.
* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. 
* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. 
* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.
* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**

Tldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra.

2024-08-28,1724848741.0,NVIDIAs next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.,"NVIDIAs current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU.

Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA.

To justify significant increase in NVIDIAs stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",wallstreetbets,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f394md/nvidias_next_catalyst_has_to_be_sovereign_ai/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9887063503265381

**Background:**

I have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers.

2024-06-09,1717937098.0,CMCSA Annual Meeting Question: Missed My Share Purchase Deadline  Now Its Free for All!,"Dear Reddit:



I have a question I want to ask at the Comcast (CMCSA) 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but I became aware of this question as a result of subscribing Comcast Business service for my home office, far too late to ask it at the upcoming meeting.  I purchased my one share on May 30th, but it had to be in my name as of April 1st for me to have the right to ask this question myself at the meeting.



I think, if you read on, you will find the question I want to ask with my one share rather juicy, and quite well developed.  Its a shame I will be unable to ask it, but, it occurred to me, why not ask Reddit?  Surely someone will see what I see and ask away.



I didnt plan this.  I didnt set out to be a gadfly.  I just ran into it.  As a customer.  This would have been my first gadfly, but, also, I just want this question asked.  I asked a few friends who might appreciate what Im trying to do, but no one had a share to sign over proxy on.



My only regret is, to make that possible, I have to post this before the meeting, which will give them time to prepare.  This would have been my first gadfly, and Im giving advance notice to the Board, simply to get the question asked, because I happened on this as a customer.



So, reddit, you want to ask my good one for me?





Heres the story, the question, and the supporting documentation is linked below it, all sources cited:



I very recently signed up Comcast Business for my home office.  See, I needed a static IP address.  And, residential service doesnt offer that.  So, I was willing and prepared to double my bill for that block of IPs.



But, there was a wrinkle.  I had to take two services I didnt want  Connection Pro, and WiFi Pro  as part of the promotional package.  The list price for these totals $44.90 per month ($14.95 WiFi Pro, $29.95 Connection Pro).  But, thats okay, because theyre provided free of charge.



I made it clear my needs did not include storefront / public place WiFi / large office building WiFi, and said that Connection Pro might be interesting, but needed details on how it works.  I was told theres a 30 day satisfaction guarantee if the Connection Pro didnt work out.



Turns out it cant be used with Static IPs, and that is literally all I subscribed this service for.



Now, I had tried to refuse these services when I signed up.  I said, theyre free?  Fine, why dont you give me the same package without them, but at the same price, then I dont have to store your gear, or carry insurance on it, or have liability for its safekeeping, and I dont have services Provisioned in my name no ones using, like an LTE IMSI tied to my name.



They couldnt do it.  So, I called up threatening to cancel, and asking them to pull them off to save my business.  Still cant do it.



I can either double my price, to an over-market absurdity, or I can take the services, and store the equipment.  They said a lot of folks are just not using them.  From the sound of it, they get a lot of pushback on this, and they have standard ways of explaining the bulk nature of the offering.  Its like Costco.



Except one thing didnt make sense.  This isnt revenue.  The services are free for the duration of the contract.  And, I can cancel them before I start to get charged, as long as I do it on contract expiry day, and as long as I maintain their equipment safely for them.  If I do not return the equipment, its $150 per device, for a total of $300.



This got me thinking&.  Thats a lot of money for equipment to generate no revenue, not even realistic future revenue, being paid for on every single new account, clearly over the marketplaces objections.



Not only did this strike me as absurd, but I can tell (subjectively) they get pushback on it a lot.



Now, if we just go by the no-return fee, thats $300 of equipment, on $207 per month revenue (1.25 GB, high end service, excluding static ips, but otherwise inclusive of any equipment fees).



Thats the 1.45 months of the shareholders revenue down the toilet in equipment expenditures, to, again, not actually increase actual cash in the door, as customers are being forced to take this stuff for free even when they dont want it.



I was unable to source the actual cost of the hardware or MSRP, so the most reliable figures I have are Comcasts replacement price.  I did ask ChatGPT for an estimate, and two bounds, given varying discounts to that estimate.  Those bands are included in the supporting spreadsheet, and you can replace those numbers with any values you have, if you have better data, to see the ROI figures.  Again, the figures I base this analysis on are the Comcast provided replacement charges.



The ROI is 6.68 months on just the list price for the two services, today, which is basically almost never actually billed to a customer.  ($44.90, as detailed above, is the revenue figure there.)



How do the shareholders benefit from buying all this gear no one wants and forcing it upon literally every account?



This led me to a wicked speculation, and a question I do not know the answer to.  In three parts.



Are these bundled services used to establish any financial metrics that the Board relies upon for financial reporting purposes? If so, could you clarify how these metrics are calculated and their impact on reported figures?



Is there a possibility that these promotional items and services are factored into executive compensation packages? Specifically, are performance metrics that influence executive bonuses or incentives linked to the inclusion of these services?



To what extent do either of these two sets of metrics factor in revenue excluding term-limited promotional pricing, which this model would fall under?



-----------------



So, reddit, I have to ask, as this is my first time, and Im basically just a pissed off customer, do I have a live one here?



Ive never gadflied before, but I would like to see the termination of this practice.



I am told the directive comes from the Marketing silo, and no one has the authority to do anything about it anywhere else in the company.



I believe the Board should be asked this question, because I simply do not see how this reflects the fiduciary interests of shareholders.



My evidence can be found at the following links:



Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJGBPc-XGnIS9SH3Abm1ozmpyaDUss\_AnRpVh3HXukQ/view



Source for revenue figures: https://youtu.be/KJ4LyuqM\_fI

Source for cost figures: https://youtu.be/yJMJyTUBpJM?t=655s



All this information is based on figures communicated directly to me in my capacity as a Comcast customer by Comcast itself.



Again, really just a customer with a home office whos really annoyed.



But, I think there is a valid shareholder concern here, and I encourage someone to ask these questions at the meeting.  I didnt find out in time.



If you get an answer, I still have two weeks to decide if I want to keep my service.



Sincerely Thanks,

Aubrey Ellen Shomo

2024-06-11,1718123306.0,DD on Snowflake $SNOW Puts Expiring Friday,"# Update on Snowflake Cybersecurity Breach Linked to Pure Storage

* Reports surfaced recently that Pure Storage's Snowflake account was hacked, with confirmations from Pure Storage ($PSTG), a company valued at over $21B.
* Both Snowflake and Pure Storage were incubated by Mike Speiser, who served as the initial CEO of both.
* This breach raises serious concerns about Snowflake's cybersecurity practices, especially given Pure Storage's prominent industry position.
* The absence of a detailed update from Snowflake ($SNOW) on the breach's scale and scope is troubling. An 8-K filing is notably missing.
* With Pure Storage's telemetry and customer data now potentially in the hands of attackers, this situation might expose significant vulnerabilities in both companies.
* Time is ticking for Mike Speiser to address this issue.

# Opinion: Strong Sell on $SNOW

* Mandiant has confirmed ongoing cybersecurity breaches at Snowflake dating back to November 2020.
* At least 165 Snowflake customers have been affected by organized criminal activities.
* Snowflake's consumption-based revenue model means it potentially benefited financially from the resources used during these breaches.
* Unlike other revenue models, Snowflake's model results in incremental revenue from resource usage during cyber incidents.
* This situation is worse than the SolarWinds breach from an accounting and regulatory perspective, with potential SEC involvement.
* The lack of internal alerts and anomaly detection for years suggests gross negligence.
* Recent stock sales by Chief Accounting Officer Emily Ho and EVP of Product Christian Kleinerman post-breach revelations further raise suspicions.

# Incremental Revenue from Criminal Operations

* Snowflake's consumption model is crucial in understanding the financial impact of these breaches.
* Unlike vendors selling licenses or seats, Snowflake earns revenue based on resource usage, including during cyber incidents.
* This breach appears to involve extensive criminal activities, with significant resource usage boosting Snowflake's revenue.
* Reports indicate over 500 Snowflake user/password combinations were found online, implicating many customers, including Advance Auto Parts and LendingTree.
* The scale of these breaches likely impacts Snowflake's quarterly revenue, with potential restatements and earnings revisions imminent.
* Snowflake must not recognize revenue from these criminal activities; doing so would imply complicity and potential RICO charges.

# Conclusion

* Given the depth of the cybersecurity issues and the financial implications, a strong sell position on $SNOW is recommended.
* Maybe I should buy calls instead, considering how dire this looks.

2024-06-14,1718354826.0,You don't understand AI hype,"I have been a lurker on WSB for some time *(ignore the account age)*, despite my lack of activity, and Ive noticed a recent uptick in posts discussing AI hype and how its surely a bubble ready to pop. This is obviously due in large part to the recent NVDA explosion, but theres more to consider.

While you guys spend most of your time focused on the money and investments side of AI, I spend my time focused on the technology itself  and the beliefs that seem to emanate from it.

Lets look at NVDA. Right now, NVDA is making its mark on the world almost entirely due to its ability to produce and supply cutting edge GPUs for companies looking to fashion larger and larger clusters and have more compute than any reasonable person could possibly fathom. Surely, this ends at some point, right? Surely, the people in charge realize that theyve built large enough GPU clusters *(never mind the hundreds of billions recently committed to building the largest datacenters on the planet by the likes of Google and Microsoft)* and Jensen stops getting orders. Surely, this ends.

A lot of people have been comparing AI hype to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s, which seems to be a fair comparison on a surface level. However, this misses something so fundamentally different about AI today that it almost entirely invalidates it.

Whether you think AI is real or a scam or a stochastic parrot or whatever, the people in charge *(Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, etc)* believe 100% that this is one of the final pieces of technology mankind will ever create. They believe that the first company that creates AGI *(artificial general intelligence  typically defined as an AI that can do any task as well as the average person)* will be the first company to create ASI *(artificial superintelligence  typically defined as an AI that is smarter than every single living human being put together)* and will end up deciding the future. And they believe this is going to happen in ten to fifteen years.

If this seems silly to you, I dont blame you. Technology typically doesnt move especially fast or change too much over short amounts of time. Its not like a refrigerator purchased today is a wildly different beast than one purchased fifty years ago. Sure, it might be more efficient and have more room, but fundamentally its the same technology.

This is how life has been ever since the industrial revolution: a new technology is invented, distributed, and then refined over the next 50 years until it basically asymptotes.

That is not what is happening with AI, and it isnt what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go ""Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!""

Whether you like it, believe it, or even choose to acknowledge it, AI isnt in a hype bubble this time. Its easy enough to look back at the last half-century and see AIs previous bubble bursts, but those were due in large part to the technology itself being substandard. Its hard to make ASI when your supercomputer has less computing power than the first iPhone in 2007. This is why todays companies are pouring what seems like an unreasonable and unjustifiable amount of money into buying GPUs  and why they will continue to. Everyone has realized that compute is all you need.

Whether or not this ends up making god in a box isnt especially important. What is important is that the companies trying to do it arent going to stop anytime soon. The risk/reward on trying to build the final thing mankind will ever build is so astronomically skewed that its hardly even a consideration. The reward for success is so vast that it makes the cost of failure *(a few hundred billion dollars)* seem insignificant.

Im not trying to sell you on NVDA or MSFT or anything like that, Im just trying to let you know whats actually going on. You cant sit there and say I looked on the internet and saw a tech bubble from before I was born, that must mean this is the same thing! because that makes you wrong. You fundamentally misunderstand whats happening in tech right now if you think this is going to follow conventional patterns.

2024-06-14,1718399060.0,DD: Cloudflare,"
This post is about Cloudflare, the only technology company in my portfolio and a stock that Ive consistently held since 2020. Most of my other holdings are traditionally cheap value stocks, however, this is a company I understand well and have a lot of faith in the management. Ive also struggled to find good values in todays market lol (with this arguably not being a value in the traditional sense either).

Brace yourself for a long post: if you make it through would love to hear your thoughts.

Strategy:

Cloudflare is an edge network that functions as a reverse proxy for internet traffic. Traffic to internet properties (which include websites) is routed through a Cloudflare server to be more secure, fast and reliable.

According to one market study:
Cloudflare is used by 78.0% of all the websites whose reverse proxy service we know. This is 18.8% of all websites.

The company is unique because it owns its underlying network and is not hosted on one of the big public cloud providers. This was a pivotal decision made in the early days at Cloudflare, because it required making fixed cost investments and solving difficult software engineering problems. There are hundreds of Cloudflare data centers (known as points of presence or POPs) around the world and 95% of the internet connected world is within 50 ms of the Cloudflare network.

People familiar with the HBO show Silicon Valley know of the fictional startup Pied Piper and the idea of a decentralized peer to peer internet. Cloudflare has some interesting parallels to that idea with a decentralized approach to their data centers. Each data center is built with the same hardware, and is not specialized for any one use case like what many other cloud infrastructure providers have built out. This allows any data center in Cloudflares network to run any app or service and software controls everything.

Management breaks down their strategy down into 3 acts:

Act 1: Application Services

The company initially focused on offering a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver and host cached website assets around the world. It takes time (albeit not a lot) to make a network request and ultimately the speed of light traveling through the fiber optic cables is the limiting factor. Today, when you visit a website, instead of going all the way to a centrally located data center (such as Amazons us-east-1 data center located in northern Virginia), your network request likely hits a CDN near where you are located and delivers a version of the website.

Historically, CDNs were very underpowered and primarily handled only storage use cases. You can think of Cloudflare as one of the first enablers of compute power for CDNs. Cloudflare also took a software defined networking (SDN) approach that did not require physical boxes on premise. Many companies to this day have physical boxes to handle networking and application services that arent adapted to todays cloud native environment.
There have always been other CDN providers in the market but Cloudflare took market share by bundling its offering with other best in class networking and security products (such as DDoS protection) effectively for free. This allowed it to amass a free user base of over 3 million people, something rare for an enterprise software company.

Act 2: Network Services and Security Services

The next chapter for Cloudflare was the rapid launch of security products. The most prominent of this group is their suite of Zero Trust Security products. Zero Trust could be explained in much greater detail, but Ill attempt to do so at a high level. Traditionally, corporate networks were built under a castle and moat model. Once you got past the moat (getting credentials or any sort of access) you were in with the power to do anything within the company network. 

The Zero Trust philosophy is that when an employee accesses any individual resource, they should be authenticated and they should only have access to what they need. Cloudflare provides the infrastructure to enable this and competes with companies like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.
Cloudflare offers many other Act 1 and Act 2 products and to not kill my readers from boredom (if they even made it this far), Im going to end this section here.

Act 3: Developer and AI Services (and other Future Trends)

Cloudflare is benefiting from this market euphoria and is establishing itself as one of the early beneficiaries of AI. Cloudflare has evolved over time to position itself as the fabric that ties together the different clouds. Cloudflare sits atop of the other cloud infrastructure providers and is well suited for some AI workloads. Customers already include top AI companies and startups like OpenAI and Hugging Face. 

One example of this market positioning is Cloudflares object store called R2 (one less than Amazons object store called S3). Based on a market survey, it seems that S3 could be about a $1B revenue business (which almost equates to the entire revenue of Cloudflare today). 

Amazon makes a strategic move with S3 to charge users to move data off their cloud, but not charge to move data in. The costs to transfer out are known as egress fees, and this is inflated to cost users exponentially more than what it costs Amazon. Intuitively this does not make sense because Amazon made fixed cost investments to set up their network. Data travels in and out on the same fiber optic cables they laid out in the past. It doesnt make sense to charge different prices for data in vs data out since the underlying cost is the same and approaches 0. The key objective for Amazon is to lock you in. Amazon stands to benefit if customers pick them and over their competitors. Cloudflare on the other hand, actually wants to enable so called multi cloud systems, since it can serve as the control plane for data movement and capture that new market.

With egress fees it can be economically unviable to use multiple cloud providers. Say Microsoft has the best AI APIs because of their OpenAI tie up, but youre a user of AWS. Moving the data off AWS to use the Azure offering would cost a lot of money. Often times, training data sets are also massive, so moving them is even more costly. Cloudflare eliminates this cost and is slowly becoming a platform of choice for AI startups for this use case.

Another market that Cloudflare seems poised to capture a share of is what is known as inference, the act of AI models making conclusions and judgements. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it is doing inference. It is attempting to make a prediction based on all the training data it has. Most use cases of AI will likely be inference since you want the model to generate a response based on what you ask it. A lot of inference today occurs in the centralized data centers and high latency adversely impacts customer experience. When Cloudflare built out their network, every point of presence was built out with the same hardware and they even reserved a slot for GPUs, processors needed for AI workloads. Now, the network can easily be upgraded and retrofitted with GPUs with minimal additional capital expenditures. Cloudflare management thinks a lot of AI inference will likely happen closer to the end user, since it is not as demanding as training which has to be done in the centralized data center. 

We are seeing this inference cloud of sorts from Apple as well, further validating this idea. I need to read more, but Apples Private Cloud Compute they announced at WWDC will be a network of their own servers to offload some of the compute from iPhones for more intensive AI tasks. Apple predictably is doing this in house and has the advantage of using their own silicon. However, this proves that local devices arent necessarily powerful (RAM is the limiting factor) to run large models we use today.

Cloudflares edge network is beneficial in data governance/localization use cases as well. Some progressive governments have introduced data collection and privacy laws. In the EU there is GDPR, regulations that give users more control over their data. One trend developing is that nations are requiring data of their citizens to stay within their borders. This is a very costly problem to solve for many of the public clouds today (even Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). They would have to spend a lot of money to reconfigure how their data centers are set up and create new software to handle how that data is routed.

The last market expansion avenue Id like to highlight is Cloudflare Workers. Workers is a framework used to program Cloudflares edge network. There are many use cases for Workers and Cloudflare does not use it in its total addressable market estimates since it is so hard to estimate. One use case mentioned during Cloudflares investor day was Meta using it for WhatsApp. Each WhatsApp message is injected with some information used for authenticating the message by a Cloudflare Worker. This happens for billions of messages per day and really demonstrates its scale and versatility. I imagine Workers will be a huge driver of revenue at some point in the near future.

Workers AI was recently launched and seems like a very easy way for developers to build apps and connect services to Cloudflares network. I will be monitoring this and seeing if there are new apps launching that use this and would love to see the developer community explode here.

Valuation:

Cloudflares products strategically complement each other and are economically attractive because of the upfront financial and technical decisions that were made when the company was founded. 

Cloudflare benefits from a zero/low marginal cost structure that technology companies often benefit from. The high fixed cost investments (building servers and laying fiber optic cables to create the network) are slowly depreciated over time through the income statement and appear in the form of capital expenditures on the cash flow statement. The network also benefits from being incredibly efficient and operates at a high utilization rate where traffic is routed optimally. 

The company generates over 1.4B in ARR and is growing at around 30%. It operates at north of 75% gross margins and is slightly free cash flow positive, but some amount of shares are being issued to fund employee stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense is the unfortunate reality at most technology companies and many try to falsely claim profitability with adjusted figures where that cost is excluded.

On to the balance sheet, where there isnt a ton of capital in this business at only about ~2B. There is only about 700M worth of equity (assets - liabilities), meaning it trades at a massive premium at 35x equity. With a stock like this youre betting on very high revenue growth and the ability to earn an incredibly high return on invested capital and equity. Although there is network capex (about 10-12% of revenues), Cloudflare is still very asset light and its servers seem to be easily upgradable with minimal additional investment. As mentioned earlier, the foresight to equip every data center with the same hardware and even leaving a slot for GPUs really illustrates this point. The asset light model is advantageous because inflation always eats away earnings growth. If you need to keep putting up a lot of capital to simply operate your business youre really fighting an uphill battle. Furthermore, given Cloudflares mission critical offerings of security, speed, and reliability, there is potential of eventual pricing power in my view. The consistent addition of new products and services also increase the value proposition and enables future price increases.

Despite all that, it is still very difficult to value this company because it implies the analyst can predict the earnings potential of the limited amount of capital that exists in the business. There is a lot of so called economic goodwill (not traditional accounting goodwill) in this business and it demands a price that is far in excess of what is measurable. However, given the cost structure, total addressable market, efficiency of the network, and strategic vision, I believe the revenue growth can be above 20% for the next 5 or so years and the company can achieve high levels of profitability. Serving an additional customer is not very costly and reaching greater scale results in greater profitability. In regards to competition, I think being the only vendor to offer products across a wide range of business needs is favorable. 

I did a simple DCF model where I attempt to value the company. Most of the value comes in the terminal stage, as this company is reinvesting back into the business to fund its growth ambitions and produces no meaningful cash today. The management team aims to generate $5B in revenue by the year 2026, which may be ambitious. I find it to be worth about $15B in todays dollars and that approximates the price I paid for it. I have added stock based compensation back in the cash flows and also increased the share count. Ive assumed most of the capex will eventually be maintenance capex. Cloudflare has proven with their architectural advantages that growth capex is fairly low. As a result, the net margin could be very similar to the free cash flow margin (lower if you add back SBC in FCF).

Management:

The CEO of Cloudflare is Matthew Prince who owns about 10% of the company. Prince has made brilliant strategic moves as discussed throughout this article and often sees things before they happen. The founding team was inspired by their professor at Harvard Business School, Clayton Christensen. Christensen is credited with one of the most influential business theories of all time: Dispruption Theory. His book, the Innovators Dilemma, discusses how many of the worlds largest companies over the course of history have faced an existential crisis leading to their fall from grace. This typically happens because incumbent companies are slow to adopt change. They ignore disruptive technologies that do not meet the needs of their main customers. These technologies improve over time and eventually overtake the existing technologies and its too late by the time incumbents adjust.
In Christensens terms, Cloudflare started as a classic low end disruption business model. They captured a large market share in networking and security products by offering their products for free. Now they are aiming to move up market to displace traditional security vendors and find a niche to coexist in the cloud infrastructure market dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. 

Concluding Thoughts: 

Cloudflare is a promising company that trades at an expensive price. I believe it is one of the few technology companies that can grow into its premium valuation over time and it remains one of my highest conviction companies. There is always risk and uncertainty when the companys value primarily stems from its terminal cash flows (and is also the only company in my portfolio with such an extreme setup). However, I am comfortable taking a risk on Cloudflare and anticipate it will be a very successful business.",wallstreetbets,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dg19ef/dd_cloudflare/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9476507306098938

2024-06-15,1718415191.0,My bull case for IONQ and quantum computing ,"IONQ is a company in the quantum computing industry and the reason Im bullish on it is due to its positioning in the quantum industry. Unlike other companies such as IBM, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN and others, IONQ is able to create incredibly accurate qubits. 

What is quantum computing and qubits?

Quantum computing utilizes qubits rather than the conventional bits in computing to solve the most complex problems. A bit is the binary value of 1 or 0 that stores data. Qubits by themselves are not interesting but that data it holds can be held in a state of superposition. This allows the qubit to be in a way, in every possible form. Once groups of these are in superposition, that data is in multidimensional space. That may sound complicated but imagine a normal computer has its bits in 2d space whereas quantum computing pushes that to the 3rd or 4th dimension allowing the data to be in every configuration. Thats just a basic quantum computer. Now to actually use these computers and qubits to solve complex problems, you must fire microwaves photons at them. The photons essentially tell it what position to be in. To change shape and read the info from that new position. 

What does IONQ do thats special?

Well IONQ has made incredibly accurate and stable qubits. Nature has created natural quantum systems in atoms that IONQ has been able to ionize and isolate. Because of that IONQ uses the naturally acurring quantum systems to create their qubits. 

Other companies such as IBM have revolutionized other areas of computing. IBM has used their chips to improve error correction of output data. GOOG is maximizing the number of qubits. AMZN also focused on error correction and the overall accuracy of its computing. MSFT focuses on quantum algorithms. Basically no other company has been able to produce and scale accurate qubits. (This is different than IBM because IBM needs the tech to limit errors whereas IONQs qubits practically have no errors to begin with)

Why quantum computing could be the future.

1: Quantum computing has the potential to simply solve exponentially more challenging problems at a much faster rate. This will be used in our everyday life from shipping routes to electric vehicle batteries development. Any problem can be solved quicker and more accurately.  

2: Quantum computing currently sits at an industry value of around 600 million with expectation for 9 billion in 2030. Thats the compounded annual growth so a breakthrough could yield a much higher potential industry value

3: IONQ has investors including Kia, Google, Fidelity, Hyundai, and a couple firms. As well as being partnered with Amazon. Its investors stemming from automobiles to banking shows the belief in the possibilities of quantum computing. 

4: Quantum computers are just cool. They sound cool, they look cool, and who doesnt love cool. If you havent seen one I highly recommend looking it up. 

Conclusion:

Anywho thats my two sense on why I think IONQ could yield massive returns. 

Positions: 127 shares while continuously buying more with the money I make. No options yet until I hear potentially large news. 

Tl;dr: Quantum computing is the future and IONQ is good at making it. ",wallstreetbets,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dg6rv0/my_bull_case_for_ionq_and_quantum_computing/,Other,POSITIVE,0.992845356464386

2024-06-17,1718595417.0,Plan to short TSLA,"Why:

Tesla sales have been slowing and tesla inventory has been building. This is apparent from reports of inventory build up around their factories, Q1 reporting, layoffs, and the April 2nd update.  The following site also shows an inventory increase but I do not trust this source entirely since some of the basic functionality on this site is broken. [https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google\_vignette](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google_vignette)

The recent tesla layoffs (late April) were a crossed the board and un-structured; reported as \~10% of the workforce. I suspect that it may have been larger than that but have nothing to back that up. They were un-structured as employees were given no notice and some key divisions were let go in mass (supercharger team) which were later brought back on. Employees were given 2 months of severance pay to prevent a WARN act lawsuit. Payment was scheduled to go out 45 days after termination. All in all we can expect that for this quarter payroll will be approximately unchanged for Q2 reporting while production efficiency will have been reduced by more than 20% (reduced moral, key employees will have been let go, other employees will need retraining to fill vital roles). this means less than 80% of the work for 100% of the pay which means reduced margins in Q2.

Speculation: Tesla does not have updated models that would entice current model 3/Y (their bread and butter) owners to buy a new Tesla. Most people who wanted a Tesla have already bought one. Competition in the EV market is building; many auto makers now have EV's available that are more attractive to the every day driver.

Tesla is way behind now on autonomous vehicles. Waymo is already online in Phoenix and San Francisco and is being brought online in LA. Tesla rejected radar and lidar technology which is rapidly decreasing in cost. GM, Hyundai, BMW and other manufactures already have level 2 advanced cruise control (this is what FSD is) online. BMW will be releasing a level 3 ACC soon. Tesla dropped the ball and is already late to the market for fully autonomous cars and is falling behind on level 2 ACC. 

 [https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/)

Tesla's robot, optimus, has not been shown to do anything useful beyond acting as a pick and place machine (these have existed since the 80's). Optimus can barely walk and is far behind Boston Dynamics (mostly owned by Hyundai). Optimus is a dead end and a pipe dream; Tesla is many years behind other companies and it's not clear if this technology will be useful considering the competitive wages of overseas workers. 

After the vote last week TSLA shot up in the pre-market then fell on Thursday and Friday. My guess is that a few, or even one, large share holder was backing out of Tesla; this was expected since this was a very divisive vote. The fan boi's have been pushing Tesla stock hard lately and although I have no proof I suspect that many influencers on youtube, twitter, and main stream media are somehow profiting through a back door means to pump Tesla and have been for some time. I have the feeling that most of us, or at least the people who have enough control to actually move markets, are seeing through Elon's BS and just need a catalyst to take a closer look and drop TSLA from their portfolio's.

What:

I plan to use \~10% of my portfolio to buy out of the money puts on 1JUL24 expiring 19JUL24. Strike price should be about -10% from stock price at that time. Depending on the severity of the 2JUL24 report from Tesla I may see either a sudden drop or a slow decline in the stock price leading into 17JUL24. After market on 17JUL24 I am expecting another drop and will close my position at market open 18JUL24 with out regard to price.

2024-06-17,1718635771.0,StoneCo ($STNE): The Great South American Short Story,"Ladies and germs, lend me your rears. It's time for the next Great South American short story. But first, please note that this is NOT financial advice. It is however a work of utter genius, to be regarded in retrospect as a pioneering tract in the oeuvre of market literature. 

TL;DR: StoneCo is a fairly dope SA fintech company with quality financials yet rapidly increasing short interest. The dumb fucks who think they can chip away at this little gem deserve to be eaten alive by the intrepid marketeers going in on shares and OTM calls. 

StoneCo is a Brazilian fintech platform that serves SMBs with payments, loans, and now general banking services. Warren Buffett formerly held this stock in Berkshire, but divested sometime in 2023, about a year and change after a moderate crisis with their loan book. Long story short, they screwed up with some regulatory features and saw a ton of debts go bad. 

After recalibrating, the company returned to rapid growth and, better yet, significant profitability. The share price appreciated in kind. However, following their recent earnings report, the company has seen a surge in short interest (https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-stne-options-data-report-2024-06-15/#google\_vignette). 

With fairly impressive numbers since going public--2021 crisis notwithstanding--the only explanations for short pressure are:

1. Increase in credit offerings has investors nervous about a crisis repeat. StoneCo has however installed ample loan loss reserves and bad loans are in line with or below industry averages.

2. The company's CEO and chairman left last year. Their departure, somewhat unexplained, could be worrying investors.

3. Revenue growth slowed to ""only"" 14% YoY--not really all that shabby considering their comps for growth were in the mid/high double digits.  

Meanwhile, earnings increased 65% YoY, as management has only started to optimize ARPU. The cross selling between payments, credit, and banking will continue to accelerate margin expansion and, therefore, earnings growth. Even if StoneCo settles at a 10% revenue growth long term--quite a conservative estimate for a company in an industry seeing 17% CAGR--margin expansion will assure 15%+ earnings growth. 

Their main competitor is likely Mercado Libre--the Amazon of South America--which has also muscled into the fintech space with great results thus far. There are a couple of others, but the market opportunity is massive, well more than enough to go around for the top players in the industry. The bad loan book aside, management has done a fantastic job, and it's difficult to imagine them not keeping apace with industry growth averages. 

$STNE now trades at under 12X TTM earnings, and less than 8X forward earnings. For a quality organization in a booming industry that just posted 65% growth, that's fucking cheap. The shorts have come in with the idea that they can scare investors away. 

As LeBron notoriously proclaimed, ""It's time to take our talents to South America."" 

Rise up, regards. Let's juice this fucker.

2024-08-29,1724891503.0,Short term Nvidia call holders- it's over. ,"Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.

No, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. 

Again, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. 

What I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. 

Positions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. 

TL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further.

Up to this point I had only been doing calls and I had lost a good bit of money from them besides CAVA so it was time for a change in strategy.

The last time I went back home from school I saw that the Family Dollar had closed after only being there for a very short time. I thought Dollar General owned FD so I added this position to my watchlist but after googling I found out that Dollar Tree owns FD, not DG. So I opted to buy some DLTR 9/20 87p instead which were more expensive.

I was hesitant to buy those puts because at the time 110$ was pretty far OTM and I wasn't sure that it would move that far after earnings. Had I bought DG I would've been rich =- Oh well back to Wendy's for a little longer. My DLTR puts did still print today following the news. 

Also a good bit of luck my regarded ass accidentally bought some 8/30 95p for DLTR because I didn't look at the expiration date and I just thought ""oh wow these 95$ puts are cheaper than the 87$ puts for the same date.

2024-08-29,1724958514.0,Why I am short on NVIDIA,"As someone with a background in data science, Ive been working with GPUs for the past 4-5 years, so I have a decent understanding of the space. Here's my thesis on why I'm shorting NVIDIA.

About a year ago, the major tech companies were severely ""GPU poor."" Getting a GPU instance on any cloud server was incredibly difficult. People, including the CTO of Hugging Face, even used the term ""GPU poor"" to describe the situation. However, things have changed.

NVIDIA has fulfilled a significant number of orders, and now, securing a GPU instance on cloud servers is much easier.

Most companies rely on Microsoft, Google, or AWS for their GPU needs. With the ""shovels"" (GPUs) already sold, the opportunity now lies with the ""gold diggers"" (companies using GPUs for innovation). At this point, I struggle to justify NVIDIA's $3.1 trillion market cap. The only way for them to continue standing out with such a high valuation is by innovating something even faster. But, in my opinion, thats unlikely to happen at the pace the market expects.

So, thats my thesis, and I'm ultra-short on NVIDIA now. I've been shorting it since the $100-$120 levels \[before results\], and I believe this position will pay off in the long run.",wallstreetbets,461.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f4ap98/why_i_am_short_on_nvidia/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9918993711471558
2024-08-29,1724962159.0,"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.","Hi regards,

This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops.

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.

The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.

First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"".

|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL|230|1,4|164|
|MSFT|413|2,95|140|
|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|
|META|516|5,16|100|
|AMZN|171|1,26|135|
|NVDA|116|0,68|170|

As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.

But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.

## AAPL

Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.

How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.

But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.

## MSFT

They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.

They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.

They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?

## AMD

I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.

Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.

Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.

And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.

## META

They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.

ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.

## AMZN

The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.

# NVDA

AND OUR STAR CHILD.
HOT TOPIC OF 2024.
THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.

So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.

Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?

H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.

And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.

Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.

**Applovin' Warning to Shareholders**

It has been alleged in a newly filed class action lawsuit in CA, that Nasdaq ticker APP (Applovin) has been engaging in the black/greyhat practice of collecting and using very private user data, without their consent. Has this been done to attain an advantage over competitors, and offer better value to their advertising clients? You tell me.

Consequently, they have had their first profitable full year in 10 years. This makes them a darling on Wall Street. Perhaps shareholders have, or will be impacted by some or all of the things mentioned here,  
**My lesson...Caveat Emptor. I need to dig into sec filings before shoveling hard earned money into ANY stock.**

The following narrative is demonstrable:

**Story 1:**

1. [Developers in the industry have been fully aware that APP has been generating revenue by using techniques that are illegal, and dishonest (harvesting very private information). ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32407906)This has been their edge.
2. [Their largest (and original) investor (KKR) has divested 99.9% of their shares.](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/kkr-entities-sell-146-billion-in-applovin-stock-93CH-3442964)

5. **The press is not aware of this lawsuit**. which will have dire consequences. 
6. This lawsuit  may cause a cascade of new lawsuits (US and EUl).

**Story 2 (perhaps tied to result of Story 1?)**: 

1. Because of the above, [for the last 2 years they have had an incentive program for their executives and its sole purpose has been to drive up share price as quickly as possible (the program says so). They vest this stock on predetermined quarterly dates.](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/applovin-corp-12319/contract/274105/#:~:text=For%20purposes%20of%20this%20Award%20Agreement%2C%20a,a%20given%20year%2C%20provided%20that%20if%20the)

Q2 EPS: $1.89 vs. $.68
Forward PE: $21 vs. $42.81
Q2 Revenue: $84.7b vs. $30b

I know NVDA is growing faster than Google, but do we really think it can keep growing fast enough to justify this valuation? 

Im not saying that NVDA is a bad investment, but I am saying that NVDA could DOUBLE its income from its historic Q2 and still be significantly more expensive than GOOG, a stalwart Mag 7 conglomerate that is consistently growing its own earnings at ~40% every quarter and has ample AI / growth opportunities of its own that are coming down the pipeline (Waymo, YouTube, Gemini, etc.).

I know GOOG has legitimate question marks about surrounding its business a whole - will the DOJ break it up, will further LLM development render search obsolete, is Waymo scalable, etc. - but NVDAs business has significant doubts as well: will big tech companies continue to spend such an insane portion of its Cap Ex on a product that has yet to return any meaningful return on investment, will big tech companies INCREASE said spending enough to justify NVDA being valued like a company that can continue growing at a high enough rate to justify its current valuation, will a legitimate competitor materialize and cut into their margins?

Im not saying GOOG is the obvious choice over NVDA, but I am saying that a lot of things have to go right for NVDA to justify its current stock price, and anyone going all in on NVDA is truly naive to think there arent better investments out there to at least shift some of your portfolio into in order to both limit your exposure and your upside.

TLDR: NVDA is an amazing company that is priced for absolute perfection, and there are other plays out there (namely GOOG) with significantly higher upside.

2024-09-13,1726257162.0,PTON has more room to run,"Long 1500 shares @ 4.99 cost basis. 

My DD:

* They've expanded their gross margin from 20% to 33% to 44% over the last 3 years, based on increasing subscription revenue
* Operating margin has improved from -76% to -20% over the same time period, due to cost cutting exercises. They're on a trajectory to turn profitable in the next \~1 year. 
* Compared to other retail sport or higher-end hardware companies, their Price:Gross Revenue ratio is really low at 1.44, compared to 5.24, 7.82, and 1.55 for NKE, LULU, and SONO. 
* Nick Caldwell joined the company as the CPO, and he helped get Looker acquired by Google. PTON is a prime acquisition target at the current EV of $3B.
* With almost 700M in cash on hand, with only -66M operating cash flows, PTON can run with \~10 more years at its current levels

Risks:

* Total revenue has dropped from 3.5B to 2.7B 
* Their hardware sales have fallen from 2.2B to only 1B over the past 2 years, which limits the size of their install base. 
* No acquisition, and they aren't able to scale distribution of their hardware to additional customers. 
* I don't understand what their loans and convertible debts entail Lol. Someone help me here, anything look weird?

2024-09-16,1726449739.0,Forget the Kelly Criterion: YOLO Everything,"Who has time for caution? Why waste precious moonshot opportunities by only betting 10% of your portfolio when you can go all in and ride the rocket? Sure, the Kelly Criterion might give you some mathematical comfort, but lets be real, this isnt a spreadsheet simulation. This is the wild west of Wall Street, and you dont get ahead by hedging bets and taking sensible risks.



Honestly, if youre only betting 10% on that once-in-a-lifetime trade, you might as well not even bother. The whole point is to make generational wealth, not crawl your way to modest gains. 10% gains? Enviable gains? Nah, we're talking about flipping entire portfolios here. Youre not in this for a sensible capital allocation youre in this to YOLO it all and come out on top.

And yeah, I hear the caution about that 1% scenario where you lose everything. Guess what? Thats the game. This isnt some safety net strategy for the faint-hearted. Go big, or go home. If youre gonna play Russian Roulette, dont worry about how many barrels are in the revolver just pull the damn trigger. If you're worried about a ""pending recession,"" then youre already losing.



You know whats even worse than losing? Watching something moon while you sit on the sidelines clutching your Kelly Criterion spreadsheet, kicking yourself for not going all in. Because when your bets dont land, youll be just as broke whether you risked 10% or 100%, so might as well swing for the fences.

If youre really that scared of losing, youre not built for this game. But if youre here to make the history books, its time to put it all on the line. Dont Google Kelly Criterion. Google how to live like a legend.

summerize: Chinese Gov will be pumping Chinese stock with their policy

----End of Facts, here is my opinion----

If you read the facts, and try to connect the dots. What do you see? Here is my thoughts.

Ken knows Yellen is going to China in person so he raises concern about National debt. Once Yellen gets to China and wants China to buy US bond (debt) or at least, stop selling US bonds.

IF Chinese gov agrees, Yellen offers foreign investments to assist China's recovery. Of course, Yellen would pick HongKong stock market as it has been the worst performance in the past year.

Stock 101 tell me, buy low sell high, and HongKongis well positioned.

If you remember, literally all US stocks were tanking during that period from April.11~19th, but recovers as assuming other HF brought it back up. And the funds sold are used to invest in HongKong stocks. I am not saying Yellen did it, but i do not rule out related HFs. (check youtube, there are some weird looking HF reps promoting HongKong market)

IF you look at FXI (US ETF tracking HongKong 50 largest cap), it has been trying to break out in the first Q and finally after Yellen's visit to China, HongKong stock index ticker ^hsi has been breaking out into a bull-run.

Now, it may be a bit early to call it a bull run, but identifying it early on gets the most out of it. If my theories landed on the right track, Chinese and US governments are pumping HongKong stock market. At least someone is(are). After all, most of the HongKong large cap companies are below 50% of its former glory some even at 30% which sets up the perfect position as US market is over-brought and HongKong market is over-sold.

--crazy idea---

Correct me if I am wrong, YINN is an ETF like SPY, its value goes up when people buy its share and goes down when people sell.

Since this ETF tracks HongKong stocks, it will reset everyday and increase/decrease base on the % in HongKong market close. Let say HongKong stocks goes up 1%, which FXI will increase 1% AND YINN will increase 3%. *note: its gain/loss is compounded*

Here is the big question. IF people start buying YINN and pump it up to $100 per share and assuming the HongKong bull run is real, wouldn't everyday be like earning call for YINN? Since if its really a bull run, wouldn't the up sides out-weight the down sides which in short, everyone makes money during the bull run, except the bears.

How do I know if I am early or late? I check the yahoo chat room on YINN/FXI, its dead empty. and I think I might be the only regard to come up with this stupid idea and something feels wrong.

Now i finished writing my thoughts, I assume Monday open, YINN and FXI will start green like how bull run should be. There will be down days, that's how they attract foreigner investors to invest.

I don't know if i should share this dumb idea, but I am still learning, welcome all kinds of thoughts and critic.

BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.

So like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**

**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**

* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.
* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. 

**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**

* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz
* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition

**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.

2024-05-20,1716246229.0,BROS is Going to go Orbital,"Hello fellow WSB enjoyers, I interrupt your usual programming to write this about a hidden gem stonk from the Beaver State: Dutch Bros (BROS). 

Dutch Bros is an Oregon-based company where they set up these [little huts ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Bros._Coffee#/media/File:DB_GPDowntownstore.png)and sell both coffee and sugary drinks that Americans are addicted to. There is very little real estate needed, no bathroom, and you best believe the products have a high markup. 

  
Despite expanding rapidly (literally opening 45 stores in like 14 states) Dutch Bros had positive income last quarter, and everything from same-store sales to revenue is way up YoY. This is impressive, as opening new stores in new places could potentially raise revenue while lowering same-store sales because of the legwork it takes to advertise a new brand, but they are managing to profit, increase same-store sales, and enter new markets all at once. 

Reading the bear case I found a few points people are making against investing in Dutch Bros. Here's why they're all wrong.

  
Ability to continue expanding: Dutch Bros has plans to open 4000 more stores in the coming years, and they have 800+ open today. I think that this is not only reasonable but they could honestly open even more stores long term. I'm from Oregon, and not only does my little town of 10k have a Dutch Bros but where I currently live, Eugene Oregon, *has 12 stores in a city of 200k*. We have Starbucks (though one of them was just vandalized) as well as small coffee shops, but Dutch Bros still manages to operate 12 stores in a 200k city that mostly consists of broke college kids. I highly doubt they will be able to operate at the same stores per capita in most other areas, but even managing a fraction of this would allow them to open thousands more. 

  
Branding: The article I read raised questions about the moat (or ability to prevent opponents from entering the industry) as well as their ability to raise the brand's profile. While I am a WSV regard and not an expert I think that Dutch Bros is in a position to easily create a strong brand. Not only is Dutch Bros seen as a cool young person brand, they already have a number of aesthetic designs that they sell on products. I couldn't find any on the official store website (wtf guys you're dropping the ball here), but my friend used to work at Dutch Bros and would come over with everything from coffee mugs to shirts (a quick google search will show you some). I am a soft drink fiend and so I haven't been to Dutch Bros in a while, but I'l pretty sure you can buy these in stores. 

The Dutch Bros Logo is straight up good-looking, their drinks have lots of pretty colors, and their drive through is an efficient and cost effective model. Dutch Bros is already a brand with a cult-following in the PNW, and there's no reason this won't be the case across the country. 

  
I'll end with two more bullish points:

The first is that people are boycotting Starbucks because for Palestine. To be blunt this probably isn't going to stop because it's unclear how Starbucks is really helping Israel in the first place. An article I found from the University of Texas said Starbucks revenues decreased 20k and the other coffee shop had a 25k increase because of this, and if this happens across the country Dutch Bros will get more business, not to mention the loyal customers they may get when the people who start going to Dutch Bros keep going there by force of habit. 

The second is that Dutch Bros has a lot of markets it can expand into. [https://www.dutchbros.com/locations-](https://www.dutchbros.com/locations-) This won't load for me right now but when I looked at it a couple of days ago I saw that DB is still absent from a lot of huge markets. The fact that they can operate without these markets and are still making a profit and rapidly increasing their revenue means that as they start moving into LA and the NorthEast states they'll have room to grow. \\



TLDR: Dutch Bros could be for coffee what Nike is for sports apparel. They are expanding rapidly and making money while doing so.

2024-05-22,1716348213.0,NVDA: Mixed Feelings Going Into The Print - AWS Is Forecasting Rough Seas Ahead - Stock Split Could Be Timely For Tomorrow's Earnings,"Nvidia has had the wildest ride these past months and shook out a 10% knife over a month ago. Brutal.

On top of all that you have rando's coming out saying they sold some profits off the top and the whole interest rate thing. Let's face it. Besides Google's break out, The Mag 7 has been sideways and hard to trade. Don't get me wrong, these companies have been up but they have also been punched in the mouth a few times. 

With that said, nothing is more peculiar than what Amazon has just done with the retiring of it's AWS CEO and more recently, their order cancellations of Nvidia's H200's. 

For me, the 2 things are very linked together. The notion that your massive cloud business has NO USE of H200's is a DAMNING statement. Not for AI, because Microsoft and Open AI are killing it right now, but specifically for Amazon AWS. 

How do you not have an ultra well-defined blueprint for where those H200's are going to go? The very notion that you would not have a plan to replace older accelerated compute AND OR expand your data centers is astonishing to me. 

The 2 companies could not be more world's apart in their AI trajectory. 

I listened to every word out of Satya's mouth on Microsoft's earnings call and the one key question that was asked over and over again was this, ""Why were your profits for AI cloud only 7% gains?"" The response was, ""There is too much demand."" Demand is outstripping supply. I can verify this is 100000% true. The one thing that is occuring with all planned projects out there in this space is the ability to service enmasse enough throughput per use case of AI compute. Now, a lot of that is latency which is improved with GPT upgrades such as GPT-4o. It's faster so you can put more throughput through the pipe and that is much better for everyone's use case and scalability. 

Moreover, Microsoft per this build event is putting AI everywhere in their product line. The AI is going to be coming out of your ears, nose and mouth. Open AI has invented HER. ScarJo lawsuits aside ""HER"" is here. It maybe version 1.0 but it's HER for sure. It is spectacular. And OpenAI keeps announcing this stuff everytime someone gets a whiff of thinking they are going to release something ""awesome"" for an AI offering. 

Everyone else is literally and desperately trying to catch up. On one hand, it's an ARM's race with Nvidia holding all the AI bullets. But in this war are there signs of defeat? In the very least there is some retreat. 

AWS may become the first casualty of the AI Wars. Reporting that they forgo an entire order of H200's makes absolutely no sense. They say they want to wait for the newer chips but that literally tells me your business model is in bad shape now and they see it in their books presently. 

Nobody, other than AWS cancelled their H200's. In fact, Sam Altman just was in a photo with Jensen getting their first H200. 

The implication here is for all other cloud providers, including sovereign nations, start to worry that they ultimately won't be able to compete on the scale and execution that Open AI and Microsoft have. 

The answer, to me, is that there is NO way, zero possibility, that the entire world is going to stand there and watch Microsoft and Open AI dominate the AI race. Asia's not going to back down, Europe isn't going to back down, Australia isn't going to back down under. Japan... Well, Japan is going to Open AI so. 

However, it is clear that AWS flinched and they're in trouble. While their cloud business may be fine right at this moment how long can them not having a frontier model start materially hurting their cloud business overall? 

Also, Microsoft's revenues are larger than many countries GDP. How much can the world really throw at sovereign AI in earnest when they don't even have the capacity to really compete financially if AWS can't even do it? 

Apple, has already capitulated and is probably going with OpenAI for their AI needs. Sora stopped a movie production studio from ever happening. 

Is this a consolidation of the AI power? 

Nvidia, must prove this quarter that this not the case. Those digital twins and DGX cloud systems need to show that there is great use. Meaning, I want to hear an analyst ask this question. 

1. What is the usage of the DGX cloud that is being provided by the major cloud companies and rest of world overall. Meaning, are people using DGX cloud offerings that are licensed and provided in the major cloud vendors. Apparently, not really for AWS. But that analysis is very important for how Nvidia data centers go. 

Yes, GPT/LLM's are one thing but all of other AI being done X GPT/LLM's and inference needs to be the lion share of the growth for Nvidia to keep powering forward.  

2. What percentage of AI workload in Nvidia's business is NONE LLM Related. This is a critical question because it would help to understand how much is all of this hype AI shit going on, how much is LLM usage, and how much is other things accelerated compute based that is not hype and or LLM training and usage. Where is the growth coming from? Robotics, protein folding, teenagers in their basement trying to make the next big video game. Where, What, Why and How. 

Even with the Nvidia offering all of their rock star concert conference offerings they are not going to realize billions from that for some time. 

I think they beat this quarter and give ok guidance. There will be a slight sell down and it gets picked up and eaten up the following day for a fantastic call heading into Q2025.

2024-08-11,1723385531.0,"AppLovin is an interesting company, but I'm somewhat on the fence.","AppLovin operates a mobile gaming company with hundreds of millions of daily active players and a software company, which was started in 2012. The company works as follows: The software division offers a marketplace, among other less important services, where companies can advertise on their apps, and other companies can place ads for their apps. These desired ads are then sorted by an in-house AI called ""Axon,"" which ensures the ads reach the appropriate viewers.

What makes this AI special is that it is fed with data from 700 million mobile gamers, which, according to the company, makes it very effective.

The software division is currently growing by about 50% annually, and in the last quarter, revenue grew by 37%.

Naturally, AppLovin has very good margins, with a gross margin of 70% and a net income margin of 20%. I also foresee growth in the net income margin through cost-cutting.

In the mobile app ad business, AppLovin is well-regarded despite large competitors like Google, and it is used by many developers, overshadowing other providers like Unity.

The CEO is also the founder and holds a significant number of shares. It's also positive for shareholders that the company is buying back shares2.5% last year and 6.6% TTM.

However, as I mentioned, there are also negative points:

I have studied the company for a long time and found some things that I don't find ideal for an investment. Regarding ad publishers, I've seen studies showing that companies make more money when they advertise through Google's program (AdMob) than with AppLovin. I've also seen many reviews where people described how their AppLovin account, which they used to run ads on their apps, was suddenly banned without any notice or warning.

In itself, I don't believe these individual issues will impact revenue, but I fear this might just be the tip of the iceberg.

I also fear headwinds from privacy changes by Apple or even competition from Google.

For me personally, I think Ill buy a small position at first because this way, I have less risk. However, with AppLovin's potential growth rate, the position could still develop into a significant part of my portfolio.

2024-08-14,1723617465.0,The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future,"Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now youre probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  

1. Microsoft (MSFT)

Now youre probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. 

Device revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing. 

So now we go to our next company. 

2. Apple

Like Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you dont personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didnt decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. 

Now youre probably thinking yeah random redditor but Apple isnt cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Ok lets keep going. 

3. Nike

Nike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you dont use their products you personally know someone who uses them. Theyre everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and its expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels havent been seen since 2018.

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but Nike isnt cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why its down. Ok lets look at more. 

4. Home Depot and Lowes

The two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home youre familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing youre paying attention to these two companies as theyre crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowes. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. 

Both Home Depot and Lowes stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowes down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. 

Now youre probably thinking ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about. Ok how about another one. 

5. Target 

Target is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. 

In 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. 

I can really keep going with this. Here is some more. 

1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline

2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline

3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline

4. Lululemon: massive stock decline

5. Dollar General: massive stock decline

6. Hershey: massive stock decline 

7. Starbucks: massive stock decline

Now what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe youre not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. 

We are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and its only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease its only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and theyre causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. 

This has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? 

I personally dont think so. However I think going forward we wont see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts.

2024-08-14,1723637688.0,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",stocks,49.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.96808260679245

2024-08-22,1724357592.0,GM-owned Cruise will partner with Uber to offer driverless rides,"Uber Technologies and General Motors' Cruise have agreed to a multi-year partnership, under which the embattled autonomous vehicle company plans to offer driverless rides to Uber users as soon as next year.

The Thursday announcement comes as Cruise attempts to revive its robotaxi business after the company ceased operations following an October 2023 incident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a driverless Cruise vehicle after she was first struck by a human driver in another car.

State and federal regulators have investigated the incident, which led to an exodus of Cruise leaders including CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, as well as significant layoffs.

Both Cruise CEO Marc Whitten and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hailed the partnership in a press release, stressing that the companies believe autonomous vehicles can be deployed safely.

""Cruise is on a mission to leverage driverless technology to create safer streets and redefine urban life,"" Whitten said in the release. ""We are excited to partner with Uber to bring the benefits of safe, reliable, autonomous driving to even more people, unlocking a new era of urban mobility.""

Khosrowshahi said in the release that Uber is ""thrilled to partner with Cruise and look forward to launching next year."" 

In 2016, Uber aimed to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology and partnered with Volvo to do so. But it abandoned the effort after a 2018 incident, in which an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a woman named Elaine Herzberg as she was walking her bicycle across a road in Tempe, Arizona. The Uber safety driver on board at the time, Rafaela Vasquez, was ultimately held legally liable for the incident.

Since then, Uber has emerged as a partner to other autonomous vehicle developers. It has partnered with Google-owned Waymo to offer driverless rides or food delivery to Uber users via robotaxis in Arizona.

On Uber's most recent earnings call, analysts asked the company how the emergence of robotaxis would likely impact the ridehailing giant's business long-term.

Khosrowshahi said on the call that ""AV players"" experience much higher utilization with Uber than they do ""without a network on a first-party basis."" He also predicted there will be a ""pretty long hybrid period as autonomous is developing and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it."" He added, ""We don't think this will be a winner-take-all market.""

Cruise competitor Waymo said this week that it is already delivering 100,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in cities where it operates commercially in the US: San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. The company is also testing in and plans to expand its service into Austin, Texas.

The new partnership isn't the first time GM has partnered with a ride-haling company. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in early 2016, with plans to eventually develop a fleet of autonomous vehicles that could be summoned using Lyft's mobile app. That never happened, as GM decided to instead launch its own vehicles and network through Cruise.

A Cruise spokeswoman said the company remains focused on relaunching its own driverless ridehailing service and app, despite the Thursday announcement.

# What could stop the Nvidia frenzy?

# Two contradictions could stymie the AI chipmaker-in-chief

IF todays stockmarkets have their version of the great wildebeest migration, it is the stampede of the Nvidia bulls. Wall Street is no Serengeti, and Jim Cramers high-pitched narration no match for the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough. But in other respects investors headlong rush into the American chipmakers shares has been every bit as enthralling a spectacle.

Galloping sales of Nvidias artificial-intelligence (AI) processors have lifted its market capitalisation from $350bn at the start of 2023 to $1trn, then $2trn, and then, this summer, $3trn. In June it overtook Microsoft, an AI-zealous software giant believed to be the biggest buyer of its chips, as [the worlds most valuable firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/06/20/nvidia-is-now-the-worlds-most-valuable-company). It proceeded to lose that titleand $900bn in valueamid the recent stockmarket panic, only to claw back most of its losses in the past few weeks. As the firm prepares to report its latest results on August 28th just about everyone expects another blow-out quarter. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang? Mr Cramer asked rhetorically on his CNBC show last week, referring to Nvidias boss. These days the Nvidia bear appears to be an endangered species. Or, as Sir David might whisper, Not an *Ursus nvidiaensis* in sight.

For every hedge fund that trims its stake in the company, another seems to do the opposite. Of the 74 Wall Street analysts who cover Nvidia and are tracked by Bloomberg, 66 advise buying more of its shares; none suggests selling. Their average price target for the stock one year from now implies a market value of around $3.5trn. James Anderson, a veteran tech investor who was an early backer, teases that Nvidia could be worth $49trn in a decade, a shade more than the total value today of the S",stocks,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f2momw/what_could_stop_the_nvdia_frenzy/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9968910813331604

The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.

You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.

Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.

I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

Then Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.

My wife and I are both signed up separately for HDHP health insurance and each maxing an HSA account through PayFlex (we work for the same company). I was interested to find out at if at any point either of us were to switch away from a HDHP Health Insurance Plan, we will have to pay a $5 monthly fee to maintain our HSA account with PayFlex (the fee is waived when youre enrolled with an employee sponsored HDHP). This includes if I were to add her to my insurance, she would no longer qualify for the monthly fee to be waived on her HSA. 

This initially was pretty concerning to me because I dont want to get stuck paying $5/month on an HSA indefinitely. However, it does look like there are other HSA options available with no fee that we could roll one of the accounts over into if need be (a Google search revealed that other banks have this option). This is correct, right? And there would be no issue doing this with one or both of our HSAs if need be?

An additional question I would like to ask is that we are paying a .03% monthly fee for each of the investment accounts that are set up with our HSAs through PayFlex. This isnt too bad of a fee for investing our HSA money, is it? Im putting the money into some low cost vanguard funds available on there.

- exit UPRO when SPY goes under 200DMA
- exit TMF when 30 yr treasury drops below 200DMA

For both, repurchase if it continues to drop
So, if either goes above 200DMA, purchase back in
If it drops 5% below 200DMA (for either), deploy 10% back in (for either, and, of the underlying holding (ie if SPY goes below 200DMA, not UPRO.
If it drops 10% below 200DMA (for either), deploy 20% back in
If it drops 15% below 200DMA (for either), deploy 30% back in

2023-11-11,1699728402.0,Has anyone invested through Serge Energy? Need tips - Offer seems too good to be true,"Hey everyone,

Roughly two years ago I found a really nice investment opportunity (guaranteed minimum 10% annual ROI over the course of 5 years) in wooden pellets through Serge Energy, a company based in Finland. 

I was a bit skeptical, so I did a ton of googling around and decided  to eventually go for it.

The amount I invested was fairly small, lets say 5k.

Over the last two years, everything has seemed fine and normal. 

My account manager calls me every couple of months (6-10) to let me know how the market prices are, considering the price of pellets started spiking due to the invasion of Ukraine.

I received a few emails with additional investment opportunities, most of them with a ROI of 12-15% per year, but it didn't really seem anything out of the ordinary considering the price of pellets had been soaring so fast that those values were still below the selling market value.

I received an invitation to a event in Helsinki, at the HQ, regarding future investment opportunities (I didn't go, but it all seemed fine).

Roughly a week ago I received a more curious email. Not from my account manager, but from two Asset Growth Executives (their title in the signature of the email).

The email basically states that they found a number of birch trees on my patch of land (the one used to produce wooden pellets) and that this is a great financial turn, since these can be turned into sheets of Veneer which will be sold for roughly 5x my initial investment and the payout of this process will be in 3 months from now. And the process of pellets will keep running, but the payout will be delayed a year.

For this to go forward, I would need to do an additional payment of roughly 40% the initial investment value (which, once again, is a fairly low value), to pay for the processing fees of the third party company who handles the wood. Serge Energy would also keep their usual 10% of the sale price of the veneer sheets.

So, in short, is this legit? 

Everything I google regarding the company comes out as being legit and I was fairly confident they were legit up until now -- since this really seems too good to be true.

2023-11-13,1699906239.0,"Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) - A classic ""toxic waste"" spinoff (Long thesis)","I tried posting this to r/stocks, but it was removed because the market cap is below 300m. As a result, you may see that the price I reference is no longer up to date. It was $13/sh a few days ago, and is now $15.50/sh but I believe it's still undervalued. I'm always trying to improve, so was hoping to get some feedback from any knowledgeable or experienced investors. Thanks for reading!

**THESIS SUMMARY**  
As of Nov 1, 2023, Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) is a tiny, ugly, spinoff of W. P. Carey Inc (WPC). No one likes this thing. Due to poor sentiment, poor spinoff execution, a bad spin ratio, a large difference between the asset type of the Parent and SpinCo, uncertainty about the value of its assets, and even just the size of the company (sub-200m market cap), it's currently undergoing a heavy sell-off. Management from the Parent are going to also be running NLOP. They're going to be issued 750k shares and 1.5m options which haven't been struck yet, so they're incentivized to see a low initial trading price for the shares. NLOP's assets are high quality (even more so considering the craziness surrounding the office property industry at the moment), with large stable tenants, a reasonable WALT, and a low vacancy rate. Adjusted book value is 3.7x their current price. This book value will be realized over the next few years because the purpose of spinning off NLOP was to liquidate the assets without a fire sale. Oh, and the cherry on top is a likely 16%+ annual dividend while you wait for the properties to be sold.

  
**INTRODUCTION**  
W. P. Carey Inc (WPC) is a multi-billion dollar REIT that owns a variety of properties spanning Industrial, Retail, Warehouse, Office, and Self-Storage. They're seeing carnage in the Office segment; there are parts of Houston and San Fran with 30% vacancy rates. Since WPC has low vacancy rates with a reasonable WALT and great tenants, they figure now is the best time to sell their office properties.

In addition, WPC is trading for a low AFFO multiple of 11x. This is close to Office REITs in general, which trade on average at 10.2x AFFO. They're trading at an Office multiple, even though Office Properties are only a tiny portion of their overall portfolio. As a REIT, this makes it hard for them to raise equity in a way that accretive - their cost of equity is too high.

So, they started to sell their properties and they've made progress in a short period of time (you can look up their Office Sale Program that's set to complete by the end of 2023). But they have 59 office properties remaining which they do not want to sell in a fire sale because it doesn't make sense to do so. These are long-term tenants like Google, CVS Health Corp , and McKesson. The best way to get their cake and eat it too is to spin these properties off into Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). NLOP will seek to sell off these assets over time, so no fire sale. And WPC immediately justifies a higher multiple to lower their cost of equity by getting rid of their toxic waste.  

""Obviously, I was excited about... the toxic waste."" - Joel Greenblatt
  
**THE SPINOFF**  
On Nov 1, 2023, WPC issued one NLOP common share for every 15 shares of W. P. Carey common stock outstanding. This resulted in 14,261,721 NLOP shares outstanding. NLOP accounts for 58 (14.6%) of WPC's tenants, 59 (4%) of their properties, 141.5m (9.6%) of their ABR, and 1.7B in gross RE value. Overall, they're not getting rid of many properties, but the properties are actually more valuable than WPC's properties on average (i.e. only 4% of properties, but 8.3% of gross value and 9.6% of rent). Additionally, NLOP has more investment grade tenants than WPC as a whole.  

In executing the spin, NLOP is taking on debt (see below), and is paying WPC a 350m dividend which WPC will use to pay off their own debt. After all this shuffling around, NLOP has about 590m in consolidated debt, which will be paid off incrementally as properties are sold off.
  
**SENTIMENT**  
Part of this whole spin-off process will involve cutting WPC's dividend to about 70-75% of AFFO (previously it was \~80%). To say that their current shareholders are upset is putting it mildly. The sentiment is vitriolic.  

The anger  
Over the history of WPC, they've attracted a specific shareholder base that wants dividend income with a safe yield that ""never goes down"". They've attracted this investor base over decades. These investors wanted utility-like cash-flow predictability. Here's what those investors get instead: WPC is ending a 24-year dividend streak. In the minds of REIT investors, this makes them ""feel betrayed"". A lot of their investors believe there was no other reason to hold the REIT - the dividend was the only reason.  

Uncertainty over the safety of their assets  
WPC didn't even cut their dividend during the GFC - one of the few REITs that didn't. That means investors believe management's confidence in the business is at 24-year lows. The weighted average lease at WPC is 9 years, and newest acquisitions have 20-year leases. Nothing wrong with that, so it must be something else... Investors think the only reason for a dividend cut is that the non-office portfolio is somehow not as high quality as management led investors to believe. Further to this, rating agencies say the ""safe payout ratio"" for a triple net REIT is 90%. What does that say about the safety if management dropped it to 70-75%? Management didn't even announce that they were considering this, so investors believe this was some sort of ""emergency action"".

2024-08-30,1725025945.0,Alibaba shares jump after it completes three-year regulatory overhaul ,"Alibaba has completed a three-year regulatory rectification process following an antitrust fine it received on charges of monopolistic practices in 2021, Chinas market regulator said on Friday.

Shares of Alibaba rose more than 3% in Friday morning trading.

On Friday, Chinas State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that, over the past few years, it has been supervising Alibabas process to become compliant with antitrust regulations. The rectification work has achieved good results, the SAMR said, according to a Google-translated statement.

In 2021, Chinas SAMR fined Alibaba 18.23 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) as part of an anti-monopoly investigation into the tech giant. The regulators focus was on a practice that forces merchants to choose one of two e-commerce platforms, rather than being able to work with both.

At the time, the regulator said that the choose one policy and others allowed Alibaba to bolster its position in the market and gain unfair competitive advantages.

Since that fine, the SAMR has been supervising Alibaba as it gets in line with the regulators requirements. Alibaba has now completed this process and has stopped the choose one of two monopoly behavior, the SAMR said Friday.

The SAMR said it will now guide Alibaba to continue to improve its compliance and efficiency and to accelerate innovation.

The conclusion of the regulatory overhaul will help put one of Alibabas worst run-ins with Beijing behind it. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Friday that the conclusion of the regulatory process was a positive for the company, which highlights this is a new start and ensures compliance in operations.

But the regulators announcement could also signal the ongoing softening stance from Chinese regulators towards private technology firms, following an intense crackdown that began at the end of 2020. At the time, Beijing enacted several regulations and moves that aimed to restrict the power of domestic technology firms in areas ranging from antitrust to gaming.

The empire of Alibaba founder Jack Ma has been in the spotlight over the past few years since regulators axed the IPO of his financial technology firm Ant Group in 2020. Ant Group itself also underwent a regulator-supervised rectification process, with most of the major issues resolved by last year.

Regulatory concerns have been an overhang on the Alibaba stock, which has fallen more than 70% from its peak in 2020. More recently, the company has been dealing with slow growth amid rising competition in the e-commerce space in China, as well as contending with a cautious Chinese consumer.

The tech titan showed early signs of a recovery in the June quarter, as cloud computing revenue reaccelerated and transactions via its e-commerce platforms looked healthy.

2024-08-01,1722487975.0,CNBC: Metas advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Metas massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the companys better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Metas core business.

The ways that its **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **theres a lot of upside there**, Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that were doing is going to improve that.

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Googles ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Metas advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the companys improved ad performance helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Metas refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**, said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBCs Closing Bell: Overtime on Wednesday. Its **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**, said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesdays earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidias graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI  popularized by OpenAIs ChatGPT  will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

Already seen a return Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

Youve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years, Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has really navigated some of the concerns and the storms from a couple years ago and is **clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.

Zino noted that Metas growth rates are **nicely outpacing those of its peers**.

**Meta isnt finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects **significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Metas AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with core AI helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that have translated into revenue gains.

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesnt expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in 24, but we do expect that theyre going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.",stocks,101.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1eh89pb/cnbc_metas_advertising_growth_is_proof_that_hefty/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9695092439651489

Given the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.

Context: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.

Position: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.

**First thoughts on the market:**

The sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:

* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low
* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle
* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted
* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)
* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison.

2024-08-31,1725094452.0,I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now,"I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. 

1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. 

3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.

2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. 

3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. 

4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.

5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.

6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue ""short squeeze"" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",stocks,465.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f5ivu1/i_think_alphabet_googl_is_the_most_undervalued/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9996286630630493

2024-06-02,1717366188.0,Nvidia announces new AI chips as market competition heats up ,"Nvidia on Sunday unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence chips to succeed the previous model, which was announced just months earlier in March.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new AI chip architecture, dubbed Rubin, ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei.

Rubin comes months after the March announcement of the upcoming Blackwell model, which is still in production and expected to ship to customers later in 2024.

Huangs announcement of Rubin appears to quicken the companys already-accelerated pace of AI chip advancement.

Nvidia has pledged to release new AI chip models on a one-year rhythm, as Huang put it on Sunday. The company had previously been operating on a slower two-year update timeline for chips.

The turnaround from Blackwell to Rubin was a matter of less than three months, underscoring the competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and Nvidias sprint to preserve its dominant spot.

AMD and Intel are two major competitors working to catch up, though their gross margins trailed Nvidias in the most recent fiscal quarter. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are also vying for Nvidias top spot, even as they are simultaneously some of Nvidias biggest patrons. A flurry of startups are also working to enter the space.

Today, were at the cusp of a major shift in computing, Huang said Sunday. With our innovations in AI and accelerated computing, were pushing the boundaries of whats possible and driving the next wave of technological advancement.

The Rubin chip platform will have new GPUs, the crucial graphic processing technology that helps train and launch AI systems. It will come with other new features like a central processor called Vera, though the Sunday announcement did not provide many details.

Shares of Nvidia were relatively flat at Fridays market close with shares trading at $1,096.

Ashkenazi joined Eli Lilly in 2001 and had been CFO since 2021. She will continue to serve on the pharmaceutical companys executive committee until her departure.

She previously served as a CFO for several of the companys global business areas, helping to manage the revenue windfall from Eli Lillys weight loss and diabetes drugs.

Porat had nearly three-decade career as as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, culminating as its CFO, before joining Google in 2015.

2024-06-05,1717614687.0,Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidias milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the companys pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industrys need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAIs ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidias graphics processing units.

2024-06-06,1717636621.0,A tale of two markets: Jobs market vs Stock market,"Its a coin flip whether the Fed will cuts rates next week or next month but my guess is they will in July, due to peer pressure. Everyone else is doing it. The Fed's  mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Price have stabilized but unemployment is getting weaker even though the stock market is rocketing higher.

The employment picture

-Job openings are declining every month. In March 2022 at peak there were 12,182,000 job openings, in April 2024 there were 8,059,000. That's a 34% decline in 2 years. I'm curious how many of the 8M openings are real jobs, actually looking for a candidate or if the recruiter forgot to take down the opening or if they are trying to keep a pulse on the current conditions without the intent of hiring someone.

The data for the stock market speaks for itself, most of the narrative has been around AI driving the gains, mostly because there isn't anything else exciting going on. Im sure at some point in the next decade we'll start to see all the AI spending show up in the earnings. Im not sure how though when most AI services are FREE. But i think for now we have seen peak earnings, i don't see how a weakening jobs market benefits the stock market earnings. Jobs fuel earnings and consumer spending and good earnings make stock prices go up(most of the time).

Dow Jones Industrial Average- Past Year: +15%

SP 500- Past Year:+24%

NASDAQ100- +30%

I think the Fed will cut rates soon because AI is disrupting the job market making their policy stance more complicated. Its not just about inflation they have a duel mandate. I think that's why Canada cut their rate today and the ECB will cut as well. They can see  whats coming on the horizon and its time to steer the ship left or hit an iceberg.

Good example of what happening in the job market, AI is slowly coming into the workplace, replacing workers with bots. We've also seen consistent layoffs at big tech companies that have coveted high paying roles(Google, META, Microsoft, Amazon). These high paying jobs going away will have tickle down effects in the economy. AI hasn't even been fully deployed yet.

Wallstreet has been so hyper focused on the first rate cut that no one is focusing their attention on the forward looking reason why the rate will be cut or needs to be cut.

2024-06-09,1717945881.0,Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",stocks,247.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dbvyv3/bear_case_why_i_believe_alphabet_will_do/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.967642605304718

Meaning if before I had 10 stocks at 500, now I'll have 20 stocks at 250. I get that part, but I couldn't figure why this is done, what does the company gains by doing this.

In California and much of the southwestern U.S., Denny's is popular with Hispanic customers for the value option, but not really for Hispanic themed dishes. Same with the rest of the U.S. dining public, Denny's is associated with value, affordability, but they really haven't communicated that to the dining public during the last 3 years of high inflation. Only starting this past April 2024 did they start advertising the all day $5.99 diner deals which is heavy on the breakfast side- 4 items plus a cheeseburger and country fried steak option.

The lack of messaging to the public has really hurt sales during this period of high inflation so instead negative reviews on Yelp, Google, Trip Advisor, other social media are creating the perception that it's a low class chain, dirty dishes, tables/chairs in disrepair. Was just at a Denny's a few weeks ago and the experience was a let down, the mac 'n brisket skillet was ok, but ordered a cheesecake for dessert- the cake was mostly frozen and the strawberry topping was dry/stale. The stock has been trashed, going well below $10 in the last 6 months, nowhere near the March 2021 reopening craze high of $19.51, it's currently trading around $6.60.

 posted earnings for the second fiscal quarter on Wednesday that beat analyst estimates. It also announced a 10-1 stock split, set to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 15.

The stock rose about 10% in extended trading.

Heres how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended in May:

* Earnings per share: $10.96 adjusted vs. $10.84 expected
* Revenue: $12.49 billion vs. $12.03 billion expected

The chipmaker expects about $51 billion in sales during its fiscal 2024 year, an increase over the companys previous forecast, and slightly higher than consensus expectations of $50.42 billion.

Broadcom reported $2.12 billion in net income during the quarter, or $4.42 per share, versus $3.48 billion in net income, or $8.15 per share, in the year-ago period.

Broadcom is one of the chipmakers benefitting from the AI boom, because its devices can run the sorts of artificial intelligence applications that have enamored the tech industry. Broadcom said $3.1 billion in sales during the quarter could be attributed to revenue from AI products. For example, Broadcom works with Google, which designs its own AI chip called a TPU.

The company also said revenue from VMware, an enterprise software company it acquired for $69 billion late last year, also contributed to its sales growth and forecast for the rest of the year.

The companys overall revenue was up 43% on an annual basis during the quarter. Without VMware sales, it would have been up 12% on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom said.

2024-09-04,1725454841.0,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

2024-09-06,1725583252.0,Broadcom says it will sell $12 billion in AI parts and custom chips this year,"Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.

Broadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.

Here is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:

Earnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected

Revenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected

Broadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.

Broadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.

The company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.

Broadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Googles TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.

Broadcoms third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware, Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcoms infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the companys VMware acquisition.

2024-09-06,1725635922.0,Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

* Verizon is already using Google-powered AI to do [customer service](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/verizon-expects-to-double-network-thanks-to-ai-demand/). Verizon claims AI can help employees answer 95% of the customers questions.

2024-09-12,1726103727.0,"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. Its been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the companys cloud businesses. The stock didnt have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

The excitement is back, Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting momentum across all business.

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia  up 136%  among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracles rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth  18% in fiscal 2023  and four times the company has contracted.

After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits, JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the companys cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsofts headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company hed competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come, Ellison said on Mondays earnings call.

Oracle didnt immediately provide a comment for this story.

# No more passwords

For years, Ellison described Oracles database as autonomous, playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Teslas board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldnt need manual patching and wouldnt have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late hes benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazons market-leading cloud with Oracles full-featured database.

Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time, AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, hes now taking on passwords, which he calls utterly ridiculous because theyre insecure and can be easily hacked.

This is the way log-on is going to work, Ellison said on the earnings call. Im going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, OK, Hi Larry. Were done.

2024-09-13,1726237757.0,Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta ,"Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabets Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Ubers app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Teslas planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Ubers market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymos 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

Were thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Ubers initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta wont include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but theyre exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, Weve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we cant wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber. 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Ubers advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GMs Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruises previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

2024-09-16,1726517905.0,"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsingers effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to evaluate independent sources of funding, and comes days after Intels board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone operating board and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand, Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intels quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidias general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the companys 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMCs forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMCs 3nm process are shipping now in Apples iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio thats currently under construction.

All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because thats the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know were capable of achieving, Gelsinger said.

This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

2023-12-31,1704013141.0,Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded. 

How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact. 

Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management? 

This cancellation doesnt look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time. 

At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example). 

Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons. 

For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs. 

This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms. 

Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they dont seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.

Lets say they didnt. 

Wouldnt it make sense to not contribute to a 401k since gains in a 401k would be taxed as income at your future income tax bracket?

You could plow that money into a brokerage, with after tax money, and never pay a dime in taxes with you arent making an income in retirement, since capital gains are 0% with less than 86k income.

I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying ""you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more""

I think that's true.

I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.

2024-01-16,1705382169.0,Offsetting Previous Losses While Continuing to Invest for the Future,"Hello, I am looking for some advice on smart investment strategies to offset my previous $100k loss against my recent capital gains for tax purposes.  
  
In 2020 and 2021, I made some poor decisions by getting involved in risky options trading without fully understanding the downsides. Over time, I ended up losing around $100,000 from these trades (short-term). It was completely due to my own ignorance and mistakes. After 2021, I realized option trading was not appropriate for me, so I stopped all forms of trading to focus on my career. Over the next six months, I worked hard to improve my skillset for better career opportunities and landed a well-paying job with potential growth prospects. In early 2023, I invested $70k into NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, and AAPL stocks. Fortunately, that $70,000 investment is now worth around $112k. I also received $17k worth of vested RSUs from my current employer which is now worth around $20k.  
  
Additional Info:

* Married couple (36M, 32F) with a 3-year-old child, living in California (rented).
* Combined household income is \~$420k ($370k base salary + $50k RSUs).
* Retirement Savings: 401k - $300k; Taxable Investments - $120k; Vested RSUs - $20k + $55k (spouse)
* 529 College Savings Plan - $7k, contribute $3k per year.

Previous Capital Losses:

* In last 2 years, deducted $6k capital losses on tax returns.
* Have $94k remaining capital losses carried forward per 2022 tax filing.

Questions:

1. If I sell my NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, AAPL shares with $42k ($112k-$70k) capital gains, the gains would be offset by my carried forward losses from previous years and I would not owe any taxes on it. The remaining $52k ($94k-$42k) losses could still be carried forward. Is this understanding, correct?
2. Does it make sense to realize the $42k short term capital gains to offset against losses, even though normally I'd owe taxes on short term gains?
3. Is it advisable to sell my vested RSUs, realizing $3k capital gains, to also offset against my carried forward capital losses? This would leave me with $49k ($52k-$3k) losses still.
4. Would the gains from my $300k Fidelity T-bills (maturing Mar/Apr 2024) also be eligible to offset against capital losses? If not, should I buy more T-bills after maturity? Context - I plan to use this for a house purchase downpayment in mid-2025.
5. For short term savings goals (1-1.5 years), are T-bills the optimal way to get guaranteed returns? Given my losses, are there better alternatives with comparable returns I should consider?
6. I'm unsure how investments like VUSXX, SGOV, BIL, USFR, TFLO compared to T-Bills in Fidelity. Could I purchase these instead for short term savings goals? Would these help recover my losses faster?
7. I know my losses carry forward each year deducting $3k in taxes until fully utilized. Without offsetting gains, it would take 31+ years at $3k/year ($94k/3k). If there is any advice on any other ways to recover these losses faster, kindly feel free to suggest.",investing,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/197uv9e/offsetting_previous_losses_while_continuing_to/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9997205138206482

2024-01-18,1705612380.0,20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,"Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments.

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*By the end of this year, were going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.

What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions

2023-12-11,1702323032.0,"Annual year-end explanation for large, unexpected drops in your fund"," Please read before posting.

A mutual fund is pooled investment vehicle with a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever.

Within the fund, the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So, dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year (because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid-December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example - a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash (and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution (except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: [https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates).

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if youre patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. Its been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. Im not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years Im up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors.

Almost a year ago, I started buying and said the stocks fair value was at least $12. After watching Modern MBA on youtube the business plan was literally obvious to see. I am also an avid user of Klarna, where my average spend per month is $500-800 with hundreds of transactions processed. I was approved for and placed an order for a maxed out M3 Max Macbook Pro (128gb, 2TB, no support) with Klarna $4950, and the rest with my debit card ($770ish). I had to put down just under $1100. I have never missed a buy now, pay later payment. I also use it for grocery shopping and put almost every purchase I make on it some weeks, including gas, candy, netflix, google domains, adobe creative suite membership, gym membership, tinder, Coachella, airline tickets, etc.

Fletcher Building NZ Due Diligence Report
Date: 26 August 2024  
Share Price: $3.00 (down 39.34% YTD)
Written and researched by: Me (With the aid of AI tools)

---

Company Overview:
Divisions:
Building Division: Engages in residential, commercial, and infrastructure construction.
Resource Division: Involves materials production and distribution, which has been a significant source of recent losses.

Current Financial Standing:
Revenue: $7.683 billion, approximately flat YoY, with growth in Residential and Development offset by declines in Materials and Distribution.
EBIT: $509 million before significant items (down from $785 million in FY23).
Net Loss After Tax: $227 million (compared to a net profit of $235 million in FY23).
Gross Overhead: Reduced by $111 million in FY24 from FY 23.
Net Debt: $1.8 billion (FY24), with FY23 figures not readily available for comparison.
Liquidity: Exceeded expectations, indicating a solid cash position.

Challenges:
Investor Confidence: Poor investor sentiment is affecting stock performance, and will likely compound to further deficits ahead.
Operational Losses: Despite revenue growth in residential sectors, the company is still operating at a net loss.
As they mention in their 24FY Report, inflationary pressure, competition, and lowered demand have further affected their performance this year.

Industry Tailwind - RMA (Resource Management Act) Reform Analysis:

Key Provisions of the Reform:
1. Reduction of Red Tape: Aims to simplify and hasten the consent process for building projects, particularly residential housing.
2. Accelerating Housing Approvals: Promotes faster processing of building consents to facilitate increased housing development.
3. Simplifying the Consent Processes: Streamlines the requirements for obtaining building/construction consents.
4. Enhanced Environmental Protection: Maintains a focus on environmental considerations while easing development processes. (Largely irrelevant.)

The reforms are being implemented gradually, not as some sort of complete overhaul all-at-once. Specific details and timelines are still evolving as of 26 August 2024.







Expected Impact of RMA Reform on Fletcher Building:

Operational Efficiency: Streamlined consent processes will reduce project delays and their associated costs, thus improving operational efficiency and profit margins.
Increased Development Opportunities: More flexible zoning and faster consents would benefit residential projects especially, which too are emphasised by the new legislation.
Market Encouragement: The reforms encouragement of increased housing construction could likely lead to higher demand for Fletcher Buildings services and products.

Specific legislative details are not yet fully available, making a precise analysis difficult. Further information will be necessary to evaluate its full and thorough impacts.

Primary Considerations on Financial and Strategic Outlooks:
The RMA reform is likely to have positive, albeit modest, effects on Fletcher Buildings EBIT. However, their current financial issuesincluding significant debts and ongoing losseswill limit any immediate benefits it may have.

Reduced gross overheads and improved liquidity suggest that their cost management initiatives are at least somewhat paying off, leading to potential financial improvements with time; especially as market conditions improve.

Investment Recommendations:
My Current Stance: Given their ongoing challenges and uncertainties, and particularly with the RMA reforms specifics in flux, it is prudent to hold off on investment. Opt to instead monitor the situation for further developments, especially with regards to progress regarding RMA reform.

Revisit this investment opportunity once more concrete details about the RMA reform are available, or the company demonstrates further improvements in profitability and market confidence. Follow closely to find the ideal time to buy in.

---

Summary:

Fletcher Building is in a period of restructuring and faces challenges from a weak market and high debt levels. The RMA reform could provide long-term benefits by easing the building process and encouraging residential development. However, given their financial difficulties and the gradual implementation of the reforms, the immediate impact on profitability will be limited.
Hold off on investment until further information clarifies the reforms effects and the companys financial situation shows improvement.

2024-01-25,1706207268.0,Capital loss and wash sale rule,"I am new to stock invensting. I am sure this topic has been discussed plenty of times. I googled the topic quite much but still did not get a clear answer. 

Wash sale rule states: ""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then purchases the same or a substantially similar security within 30 days, before or after the transaction.""

I totally get that we cannot buy it within 30 days after the transaction, but I am not clear about the situation when we buy it within 30 days before the transaction. Does this mean if I buy a new stock, and then sell it after three days with a loss, I CANNOT claim a capitial loss since I buy it ""within 30 days"" prior to the transaction (the sale)? I try to use the following hypothetical scenarios (using very popular VTI and VOO as examples) to understand this problem.

Scenario 1:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and unfortunately market crashed, and I sold all shares on Thursday with a value of $9K, and then bought VOO with the money and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $1K?

Scenario 2a:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  I sold all shares the next Tuesday with a total worth of $17K. I then bought VOO with this $17K, and held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $3K?

Scenario 2b:

I bought $10K worth of VTI on Monday, and then market crashed. In order to decrease my average cost, I then bought another $10K worth of VTI on Thursday. But the market was still trending down.  On Tuesday of the next week, I sold the shares I bought on Monday, with a total value of $8K, but kept the shares I bought on Thursday. I then bought VOO with this $8K, and then held it for long term. Can I claim a capital loss of $2K?

2024-01-25,1706207813.0,One common mistake of a novice trader,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.

It's also lacking a lot of technical jargon when it comes to Bitcoin Mining and investing since not all my friends are not super versed in crypto and investing.  
Company : Terawulf  
NASDAQ stock Ticker : **WULF**  
Based out of Maryland, USA  
**SYNOPSIS**  
The WULF stock price of $2 is very very undervalued.  
This belief is heavily based on the fact that after expenses the company is currently pulling in $500,000 a day (including weekends), yet its market cap or total value of the company is only about 500 million.  
Imagine buying a penthouse for $5 million dollars and then being able to rent it out at a fair market price for $1.8 million dollars a year. It would seem as if the penthouse was sold for way under value.  
Below is an in depth explanation on why Terawulf is way under value.  
**WHAT DOES TERAWULF DO?**  
Terawulf has built two facilities in New York and Pennsylvania that are basically two huge state of the art computers. Theyve built these computer facilities to create an enormous amount of computing power. They then use this computing power to make money.  
For Example: AI or artifice intelligence requires a lot of computing power. Terawulf is currently working with Talen and Amazon where they might sell their computing power to Amazon to power Amazons AI. Basically Amazon rents Terawulfs facilities computing power, instead of building their own.  
This potential Amazon deal is however a speculative future endeavor and not why I am writing this today. It just helped me explain what Terawulf has built without using the scary B word... Bitcoin.  
However, thats exactly what Terawulf is doing with their computing power.  
They are mining Bitcoin or using their computing power, to help run the Bitcoin network. Similar to how Google could hire Terawulfs computing power, to help run their email system GMAIL.  
Terawulf, gets paid in Bitcoin daily, and immediately sells it for a hefty profit. The Terawulf CEO has invested millions of his own money into Terawulf and stated that the company is not in the business of speculating on the price of Bitcoin. They simply Mine Bitcoin everyday for a profit in American Dollars, not Bitcoin.  
**TERAWULFS BACKSTORY**  
TERAWULF was formed in 2021, and their plan was to lock in long term cheap North American power (5-20 year plans). Not just any power, but Zero Carbon energy. Not only is it better for the environment, but in a world where regulations are moving in that direction, its better to be ready for it.  
Once they locked in inexpensive green power, they bought land and started construction on buildings. Right now they have buildings in New York and Pennsylvania. Two states that have had discussions and laws even passed against companies mining bitcoin... but mining bitcoin with bad energy. Since Terawulfs goal is 100% carbon free energy, they dont have to worry.  
Terawulf spent all of 2021 - 2022 getting their facilities ready. They started turning on the computers in 2023, but are still building and turning on new machines for 2024, and anticipate this continuing into 2025.  
This all leads into why I believe they are so undervalued.  
**STOCK PRICE**  
Terawulf began this venture in 2021, during the last cryptocurrency bull run. Speculation was crazy in 2021 around anything crypto and Bitcoin related. Along with many other assets and mining companies, WULFs price rocketed to a high of $44 per share in Nov 2021.  
However soon after Bitcoins price went down and so did Terawulfs. WULF shares dropped as low as $0.53 in March 2023.  
Rightfully so, I mean Terawulf up until that point had just taking on hundreds of millions in debt to build their facilities. According to their earnings reports this company just lost money month after month, year after year. They were an idea in 2021.  
Most people dont know what Bitcoin Mining is, so they see Terawulf, they see its a bitcoin mining company and dont really know what the hell that means.  
Theyre investors not computer tech folks. So they look at what they do know, the earnings reports and well, the earnings reports are terrible. They dont know why or care, however we now know its because Terawulf is still in the building stages.  
Its as if Ferrari spent over two years building a race car. But every month people asked how fast the race car was, and Ferrari said it went 0 mph. So everyone continued to write off this race car as a failure, without knowing that it was going to take 3 years to build.  
They shouldnt judge how fast it goes until its built, just like the market shouldnt have judged Terawulf on how profitable it was before it was built.  
I think the stock market thinks Terawulf is a fully built race car that goes 0mph, when in reality it is a half built race car that when fully built, will be the fastest car in the race.  
Earnings reports are a major factor in how investors judge a company. Most articles and reports online are based off Terawulfs released earnings reports. Those earnings reports dont go past sept 2023, and those reports are very bad.  
Currently, when you research Terawulf online, youre likely to find a writeup that an algorithm wrote based off earnings reports before Oct 2023. The reports are filled with BAD numbers, and dont explain that Terawulf was simply building their race car.  
Now normally everyone has to wait until the company releases its earnings report to know how everything going. Not with Terawulf though.  
Terawulf is not your average company, they are very transparent and have been releasing their numbers on their social media and their website. They are proud of what they accomplished and believe in a company that doesnt hide behind walls, but instead informs investors of exactly what is going on.  
They dont pay for fancy marketing, they just make a damn good product and wait for word to catch on.  
However, NOBODY is reading Terawulfs reports... their twitter posts get maybe 100 likes, and a few spam comments.  
So unless youre one of the few like me listening, you are judging their company on the terrible earnings reports from 2021 thru September 2023.  
However they just started turning on their machines in 2023, and have been expanding at a rapid rate throughout 2024.  
On Fidelity and Charles Schwab if you click on reports for Terawulf and look at earnings... MISSED in big red letters pops up.  
For investors its basically saying LOSER LOSER LOSER, over and over and over.  
However, on March 28th 2024 the official earnings report comes out for Oct-Dec 2023.  
Now if youre following Terawulf on social media and understand Bitcoin Mining youd know that Q4 was a bit of a winner this time. Youd also know that Q1 of 2024 is an even bigger winner. However, the vast majority of people simply wait for the official earnings reports.  
Basically we are ahead of curve by 6 months.  
I dont know when exactly Wall Street is going to catch up on this, but right now WULF seems like a diamond in the rough. The confusion around what exactly is Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, mixed with the delayed earnings reports has falsely labeled Terawulf a loser.  
I anticipate that between now and summer of 2024 the market will catch on.  
We discussed the price of the stock versus the earnings of the company. This is called a P/E ratio for short. Terawulfs P/E ratio right now is about 4/1 since the entire value of the company is four times more than their gross earnings for the year.  
In comparison to the software industry average of 56/1 which is what fidelity chose to compare it to Terawulf to.  
A 56/1 P/E for Terawulf would value the stock $28 a share instead of $2 a share.  
MARA Marathon Digital is a mining company that has a current P/E of 23/1. WULF at $11 a share would be a 23/1 P/E.  
Now there are many other factors to consider and I think $10 a share is closer to a fair value.  
I also think the stock could go to $100 a share considering how crazy the market can get, especially around something with the word Bitcoin in it.  
However I am not an expert with how to value a company like this, should it be 3 billion or 10 billion, Im not sure. What the stock market values is a best guess.  
Theres so many things to consider, and nothing is guaranteed in this world. A comet could hit the Terawulf facility and blow it up tomorrow and drive the price to a few pennies.  
Im not a finial advisor, I have no idea your finances nor can I guarantee my beliefs or that I am missing something. Im simply stating what I find interesting about this company and sharing that info and my beliefs.  
Anyway, thanks for reading. Below is some more info to consider.  
**DEEPER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE**  
SHORTS  
Another reason why the price is so low, are the shorts have been opening up on this stock since 2022. This is just speculation, but I believe these shorts are coming from knowledgeable traders, who understood they would be out of profit for two years, or lenders who have hedged their investment.  
For anyone who doesnt understand Shorts, its basically a way to make money if the stock price goes down, and coincidently, investing in a short position on a stock helps drive the price down.  
The shorts are slowly beginning to close and I have a feeling those shorts will close up completely by June 2024. Shorts closing brings stock price up.  
TRENDING BUZZ WORDS CREATING HYPE

I'm my mind, it's obvious. Ignore everything else about Trump, just looking at the financials of this company, it's a social media platform that is not growing, and how people are buying on a hope and a prayer. It's a bubble, even the most generous evaluation of the stock says it's overvalued by a lot, the numbers simply do not match reality. And there is even a road map to when it would pop because in less then 6 months Trump can sell his stake.

I'm my mind it's perfect. I mean, the way you lose money on a short is you expect after X time, the stock went up, not down. But in this case, it seems like there is a very obvious time when it's going to crash, if not before. And as for going up???? Only if some massive tomfoolery happens.

My mom looked at me and said ""No, it's a scam, it's a pump and dump, we wouldn't make money."" She also hates the idea of shorting a stock, I think it bit her or her dad (my grandfather) at one point. But it seems like this is the closest thing to a sure bet one can get. 

But then I thought wait, rule number 1 above all in the stock market or any gambling of any kind, ""the only sure thing is that there is never a sure thing.""

So, am I missing something? Should I avoid what looks like a very golden goose because it's all lead?

And, if I did, this would be my first time ever shorting a stock, how would I do it? I have a Fidelity. I have no intention of taking any loans out or anything, just using some cash I have on hand.

I'm trying to research Berkshire Hathaway, but the numbers I see online are inconsistent and don't make any sense. It seems like data reporting sites may be getting confused by the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has two different classes of shares - though it seems like this *should* be something really basic that financial reporting sites should be equipped to handle.

Google says there are currently 2,170,386,415 outstanding shares of BRK.B. At $409.59/share, that's a total value of all BRK.B shares of about $889 billion.

Google says there are currently 1.43 million outstanding shares of BRK.A. At $619,160.00/share, that's a total value of all BRK.A shares of about $885 billion.

Combined, that gives a total market cap for the company of about $1.8 trillion.

Google says Berkshire Hathaway's total earnings for 2023 were $96.2b.

Dividing that market cap by those earnings gives a PE ratio of about 18.7.

Coca Cola was founded in 1892 whereas Pepsi was incorporated 6 years later in 1898. Since then, both companies have competed for the top spot. A famous example of that competition is the Pepsi challenge, which Pepsi started in 1975. In fact, both companies attack each other so much in ads that some argue they have shaped modern marketing. Even though Coke was the undisputed winner at first, it's hard to say that today. Globally, Pepsi is the brand with a better social media exposure and better consumer sentiment. However, Coke has the bigger reach.

So, which company is the better investment choice? We all know that Warren Buffett invested in Coke during the eighties and has made billions from his investment. To this day, Coke continues to be a big position for Buffett, currently standing at number 4, making up almost 7% of his portfolio. Would you imitate Buffett and buy Coke?

2023-09-23,1695498718.0,"From Beaks to Bytes: Genetic Algorithms in Trading, Investing, and Finance","While the buzz on social media might lead you to believe that Artificial Intelligence is all about chatbots and automated text completion, the reality is far more complex and intriguing. Major tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI might have popularized language models, but AIs capabilities stretch far beyond being a glorified typing assistant. It encompasses a rich tapestry of fields, from reinforcement learning to specialized search algorithms.As someone rooted in the world of biology, Im captivated by a lesser-known but incredibly powerful area of AI: genetic optimization. In laymans terms, imagine a computer algorithm that evolves and adapts just like species in the natural world. Sounds intriguing, right? This article aims to break down this complex topic into bite-sized information, suitable for anyone  even if youre neither a biologist nor a financial wizard. Well also enrich this explanation with concrete examples to help you see these algorithms in action.

# From Finch Beaks to Financial Peaks: Understanding Genetic Algorithms

Remember high school biology where you learned about Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection? Darwin studied finches in the Galápagos Islands and noticed that they had different beak shapes, each finely tuned for their specific diets  some for cracking seeds, others for sipping nectar, and yet others for capturing insects. Over time, the finches with the most useful beak shapes survived and had baby finches, passing along their winning traits.

In the realm of computational science, particularly in the domain of optimizing algorithms, a similar evolutionary process takes place through a methodology known as genetic optimization. Imagine you are developing an algorithm to forecast stock market behavior. Various iterations of your algorithm demonstrate distinct strengths: some may excel in volatile environments, while others may be optimized for long-term trends. Genetic optimization acts as the computational equivalent of the Galápagos Islands; it identifies the top-performing strategies and combines their most effective features to create a new generation of even more robust algorithms.

# The Six Pillars of Genetic Optimization: A Biological Symphony in Code

Imagine youre on the Galápagos Islands, watching a group of finches go about their lives. Some have beaks crafted for nectar sipping, while others have sturdy beaks perfect for cracking seeds. These distinct features arent random; theyre survival tactics, granting each bird access to a specific food source. Now, consider a finch family with both long and short-beaked parents. They have four chicks, and by a stroke of genetic fortune, one inherits a beak even longer than her long-beaked parent. This unique feature gives her exclusive access to deeper flowers, while her siblings with mid-length beaks struggle to specialize in either nectar or seeds. In this harsh survival game, her specialized feature gives her the upper hand. Yep, its survival of the fittest, Darwin-style.When we think of genetic optimization, were essentially talking about a six-step process, repeated over and over until we achieve our optimal solution. These steps are:

1. **Initialization**: Setting the Population and Fitness Metrics
2. **Selection**: Choosing the Fittest Candidates
3. **Crossover**: Mixing Traits (Recombination)
4. **Mutation**: Introducing Random Changes
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the New Generation
6. **Replacement**: Swapping Out the Old for the New

In this exploration, well delve into each of these pillars to understand how the age-old wisdom of biology serves as the muse for modern algorithmic optimization. Each of these steps, intricately modeled after natural processes, works in concert to refine and evolve our algorithms toward the pinnacle of performance.

**Initialization: The Genesis of Algorithmic Optimization**

In the natural world, every ecosystem begins with a diverse population  be it finches on an island, bacteria in a petri dish, or whales in the ocean. In the realm of computing, our population is what we aim to optimize, and its often encoded as a string of numbers.Consider the world of algorithmic trading: we kick-start the process with a variety of trading portfolio strategies. Some might be conservative, triggering stop losses at a mere -3% and aiming for gains at +3%. Others might be more adventurous, with stop losses set at -30% and profits at +30%. These different portfolios make up our initial population.

After we have an entire population, well convert each of our portfolios into an array of numbers. This is especially important for later parts of the algorithm like selection and mutation.

[We create many variations of a portfolio, then convert them into an array or tree-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/vuWpTBB.png)

After we have our population of individuals, we need to decide what it means to be a fit individual. For algorithmic trading, one way we can do this is by running trading simulations or backtests. We can then use the performance of the backtest and optimize for certain metrics, like sharpe ratio, percent change, or drawdown.

[We can optimize for different metrics, including percent change, maximum drawdown, and sharpe ratio.](https://i.imgur.com/KsrA3yb.png)

**Selection and Crossover  How our strategies breed**

Just as nature selects the fittest organisms to carry on their genes, so does our algorithm pick the best portfolios for the next generation. Though selection can be random, more often, it leans towards those that are fit, or in our case, portfolios that perform well based on our chosen metrics.For the sake of simplicity, well say individuals in a population mate at random. In our portfolio example, that means taking a random pair from the population and combining their genetic information.

[Two common forms of Crossover are Random Crossover and N-Point Crossover. The important thing here is that an offspring that looks like both parents is generated](https://i.imgur.com/ETp6kvw.png)

We perform this crossover operation tens, hundreds, or thousands of times. One common heuristic is to generate a new population thats the same size as the old population. With that, weve now doubled our population size. Incredible!

**Mutation  Introducing Variation in the Population**

Lets return to our Galápagos finches. Mutations in their genetic code might lead to subtle changes in beak size or shape. Most of these changes may be inconsequential or even detrimental. But every so often, a mutation could result in a beak perfectly suited for a previously untapped food source, allowing a finch lineage to dominate a new ecological niche.In the algorithmic world, mutations serve a similar disruptive yet constructive purpose. They introduce randomness into the genetic optimization process, helping to avoid local minima and explore the vast landscape of possible solutions. Just like biological mutations, algorithmic mutations can sometimes produce undesirable outcomes. However, on occasion, they can bring forth truly ingenious solutions that would not have been achievable through conventional methods. For example, in an algorithm designed for trading, a mutation might alter the parameters used to calculate the optimal point to buy or sell a stock. While this change may initially appear random and potentially harmful, it could unlock a strategy that significantly outperforms its predecessors.In practice, a mutation is typically performed by altering one or more elements in the array that represents a portfolio or any other object of optimization. The extent and impact of this mutation can vary widely. A soft mutation might involve the adjustment of a single parameter, such as the percentage at which a stop-loss order is triggered. In contrast, a hard mutation could involve significant alterations to multiple elements in the array, akin to a large-scale genetic mutation in a biological context. It is worth noting that the absence of physical constraints in the computational domain allows for a greater range of possible mutations compared to biological systems.

[A mutation alters the offspring in some way thats distinct from characteristics of their parents](https://i.imgur.com/s5zGI8S.png)

Both in nature and in algorithms, mutations serve as one of the critical mechanisms for driving evolutionary progress, pushing boundaries both in the organic and digital realms.

**Evaluation and Replacement**

In biological ecosystems like Darwins Galápagos Islands, the process of evaluation is a relentless one, executed by the natural environment. Those organisms ill-suited to their surroundings  such as finches with beak shapes that do not facilitate efficient foraging  find their survival and reproductive prospects severely compromised. Conversely, organisms exhibiting advantageous traits not only survive but also pass these traits to subsequent generations, contributing to the evolutionary success of their lineage.Drawing a parallel to algorithmic trading, the evaluation phase serves a comparable function. Here, each portfolio, optimized for particular market conditions, undergoes an exhaustive evaluation process. This involves running a series of backtests and simulations that quantify their performance based on specific metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, percent change, and maximum drawdown. These metrics function as the fitness criteria, allowing us to identify which portfolios are most capable of meeting or exceeding predetermined trading objectives.

[We convert the child back to a portfolio and evaluate its performance](https://i.imgur.com/iXh8iN3.png)

Upon the completion of the crossover and mutation stages, the newly created child portfolios are reintroduced into the existing population. Each member of this augmented population is then evaluated based on the aforementioned performance metrics. Subsequently, the entire population is sorted in descending order of their fitness scores. To maintain population size and focus the evolutionary pressure, the least fit individuals are culled, leaving a new generation of portfolios that is incrementally superior to its predecessor.

[Evaluate the performance of all portfolios in the population, then retain only the top-performing ones, thus ensuring that each new generation is more fit than the last.](https://i.imgur.com/abKpe8z.png)

# Conclusion: Bridging Biology and Algorithmic Trading through Genetic Optimization

Artificial Intelligence is undeniably a multifaceted discipline that transcends mere language models or data classifiers. It is an embodiment of our drive to replicate and even surpass the efficiencies and wisdom found in nature. Genetic optimization serves as a striking testament to this truth, translating the principles of biological evolution into computational practices that refine and optimize algorithmic systems.Leveraging genetic optimization in the world of algorithmic trading offers us a cutting-edge approach to navigating the complex, dynamic landscape of the financial markets. Like Darwins finches, our trading algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time, driven by the unyielding forces of simulated natural selection. This technology, much like nature itself, offers no guarantees, but it does provide a framework for sustainable development and, potentially, remarkable innovation.Through the six pillars  Initialization, Selection, Crossover, Mutation, Evaluation, and Replacement  weve looked at how the science of genetics can inform and enrich our algorithms. Each pillar not only simulates a specific aspect of the natural evolutionary process but also serves as a critical component in our quest for computational excellence.For those of us who bridge disparate fields like biology and finance, the application of genetic optimization to algorithmic trading is more than just a technical achievement. Its an exciting symbiosis of natural wisdom and artificial intelligence, and a potent reminder that in the world of AI, the possibilities are as limitless as evolution itself.

2023-10-02,1696212480.0,My Willy-Nilly Stock Portfolio,"Hey, guess what! I'm beating the market YTD!

My make-believe portfolio is up 12.2% vs. 11.8% for VOO, a whopping 0.4% advantage.

I think the returns are purely the product of luck and realize that my lead over VOO could evaporate at any time. We'll see. It kind of proves Peter Lynch's belief that any moax can beat the market but with a caveat: ***if you're lucky***.

2024-04-04,1712248664.0,PSA for those 'investing' in UNG or BOIL,"It made me sick to my stomach that I had to give my dad 'the talk' for the second time about 'investing' in UNG and BOIL. He's retired on social security, and keeps dabbling in UNG/BOIL to express his views on natural gas. And regardless of how wrong he's been on the direction of nat gas, he has had trouble understanding how the structure of these ETFs has been even more destructive to his portfolio than his views on natural gas.

UNG owns the front month contract, and periodically rolls that position into the following month contract. Based on the shape of the futures curve ([https://oilprice.com/futures/natural-gas/](https://oilprice.com/futures/natural-gas/)), the June contract costs 2.015 and the May contract costs 1.794. If you were to roll the May futures into June futures today, you'd lose around 11%. If you rolled every month for a year and lost 11% each time, you'd lose around 75% over the course of a year, assuming the price of nat gas and the shape of the curve are stable for the whole year. Even if NG has a bullish move, that roll cost drag creates a massive bogie to overcome. This vehicle is not appropriate for expressing any view on NG prices beyond a VERY short period (days/weeks).

As if that weren't bad enough, BOIL does the same thing - but with 2x leverage! Assuming it now costs you 22% each month to roll to the next month, over the course of a year, you lose 95% just on roll costs. Even if NG is discovered to be a magic elixir that, when ingested, cures all illness including old age...and the entire global population switches from drinking water to drinking LNG; even in that farcical scenario, you'd probably still lose money on BOIL over the course of a year.

If you have a bullish view on NG and absolutely have to express it, please consider UNL instead. It's run by the same sponsor as UNG, but instead of only owning the front month contract, it owns each of the next 12 months' contracts at equal weights, and only rolls one month at a time, or 1/12 of the portfolio each month. That dramatically lessens the pain of the roll cost when the futures curve is upward-sloping (as it often is). Just be careful and consider using limit orders since UNL is a much smaller fund than UNG or BOIL, and accordingly has wider bid/ask spreads.

To hammer home this message, over the past 5 years, UNL has lost 25%, UNG has lost 83.5%, and BOIL has lost 99.65%. In order to get back to even in each one: UNL would have to gain 33%, UNG would have to gain 506%, and BOIL would have to gain **28,471%!!!** All while still eroding from their respective roll costs.

**TLDR:** Please understand what your ETFs own and what they're designed to do. If they own futures, know which ones they own, how often they roll, and keep an eye on the futures curve so you know how much the roll cost is eating into your capital on a regular basis. And for the love of God, don't buy a leveraged ETF that owns futures with an upward-sloping futures curve unless you know exactly what you're buying, and for how long (minutes/days at most).

And if this was all greek to you: just avoid buying commodities ETFs or ETNs, and instead stick to equity and bond funds.

PRO TIP: Google ""\[symbol\] fact sheet"" and look at recent fund holdings to see what your ETF actually owns.",investing,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bvru62/psa_for_those_investing_in_ung_or_boil/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9994385838508606

I think I did ok (didn't lose any money) but my returns weren't that good, all things considered. 3-4% for some years and 4-6% in other years. 

I was doing a more thorough audit of my finances this year and I regretted not just putting everything in a few choice ETFs...until I remind myself that I didn't know then what I know now. Plus there were other factors in the way such as family entanglements and unhealed mental illness. 

I initially thought that to be an Investor (TM) you needed to understand every single thing on every broadsheet and watch the markets 24/7...until I did more reading and spoke to a friend of mine who is a full-time investor and she says that she doesn't know all that. You need to know enough to make money consistently, that's it.

So I while do know what are alpha, beta, Sharpe Ratio, candlestick theory are etc...I just want to manage my money, I'm not trying to become a CPA. For what it's worth, most FAs that I speak to are impressed with my knowledge base. 

However, I believe in always being humble and learning more, hence this post. Is there a point to when you feel that you can go it alone? When Googling this question the answer that always comes back is ""everyone's situation is different"" different factors etc. But here I'm talking mainly about financial knowledge and how to apply it.

Basically at this point I would be happy to buy several Vanguard growth ETFs and kick back and relax while saving the fees that I pay my FA.

\- Average revenue per user is $3.42, but that is buoyed heavily by the US cohort that has a $5 ARPU vs. $1 ARPU globally. Compare this to Facebooks ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.

\- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddits $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.

\- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers. CJ Gustafson notes in his analysis of the S1, The company's advertising revenue is mainly derived from a small number of advertisers, with the top ten largest customers accounting for approximately 28% and 26% of its revenue for 2022 and 2023, respectively.

March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S",investing,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b3zmhb/once_a_hot_stockmarket_trend_has_a_name_its_best/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9871900677680969

2024-03-03,1709456226.0,Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?,"Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  

Hello Everyone,

Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?

Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$

We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.

This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%

The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.

For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.

I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.

Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.

Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.

Disclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.

Why is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!

3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!

I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",investing,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b5cq85/risks_of_investing_in_etp_exchange_traded/,Other,NEGATIVE,0.9986942410469055

2024-03-04,1709570452.0,Was told by an advisor to completely change my taxable brokerage portfolio,"Hi all. I recently had a free call with a financial advisor with Empower (my 401k provider). I have been considering going to a local fiduciary fee-only financial advisor service, but figured I'd give the call with Empower a shot first. I have my taxable brokerage account linked up with empower so I can track all my investments in one place. This means that the folks at empower can see the linked accounts and their holdings.

It was a quick 30 minute call where I was able to ask a lot of general questions I wanted answers to. One of the things he recommended to me was completely redoing my taxable brokerage portfolio. Over the past couple of years I have been making automatic direct deposits into my brokerage account every paycheck, and investing in low cost ETFs and high dividend paying ETFs and securities. I also have DRIP enabled so that the dividends would compound and buy more shares and eventually the goal was to get to a sizeable chunk of income that can be relied upon.

The advisor at empower said that at my age I need to be focused on growth only, and that high dividend-paying securities aren't very tax efficient at my age. I am 30 years old. Currently, about 30% of my portfolio is in good stocks that I like (PEP, XOM, MNST, INTC, VZ, T), and the other 70% is in low cost ETFs. Of that 70%, I have roughly 8% SPY, 5% VOO, 4% VUG, 7% QQQM, 16% JEPI, 11.5% JEPQ, 10% SPYI, as well as a few other randoms here and there. I went a little crazy researching low cost ETFs and ones with good dividends and just picked a few that I liked, instead of putting everything into one. I was mainly using JEPI and JEPQ for their divys. I know this portfolio isn't anywhere near 'balanced' so I would definitely like to make some changes. For instance I know SPY and VOO are very similar. I started investing in SPY first, and then found that VOO had a lower expense ratio and the shares were slightly cheaper. This makes buying more shares easier because currently I can't purchase fractional shares of ETFs through my brokerage (Schwab).

Long story short the advisor at Empower told me I should basically sell everything, and do 50/20/20/10 into an S",investing,156.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b6fi6e/was_told_by_an_advisor_to_completely_change_my/,Other,POSITIVE,0.9631732106208801
